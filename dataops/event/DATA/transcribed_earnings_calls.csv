  ""text"": ""Hello, everyone. Thank you for attending today's Q1 fiscal year 2025 Snowflake Earnings Call. My name is Sierra, and I will be your moderator today. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. If you would like to ask a question, please press star, followed by one, on your telephone keypad. I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Jimmy Sexton, Head of Investor Relations. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us on Snowflake's Q1 fiscal 2025 earnings call. Joining me on the call today is Sridhar Ramaswamy, our Chief Executive Officer, Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer, and Christian Kleinemann, our Executive Vice President of Product, who will participate in the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial results for the first quarter fiscal 2025 and discuss our guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2025. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our business operations and financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ mentally from actual results. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is available in the earnings press release, our most recent form, 10A and 10Q, and our other SEC reports. All our statements are made as of today based on information currently available to us. Except as defined by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Sridhar. Thanks, Jimmy, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into it, many of you have given me a warm welcome to my new role over the past few months, and I just wanted to say thank you. I've been focused on three key priorities in my first quarter at CEO. Listening to and learning from our customers, driving execution and alignment within our go-to-market teams, and fueling our innovation and product delivery. I have been really impressed by how the team has responded and by our overall pace of play. We have a lot of opportunity ahead of us, and there's a lot of excitement across our company to go and get it. When I look at the Snowflake growth story, it was first driven by an amazing data product, and then by the layers of collaboration and applications that we added on top to make Snowflake a true data cloud. What is exciting about AI is that it can turbocharge our capabilities and growth on all three layers. It also helps democratize access to all the amazing enterprise data in Snowflake, massively increasing our reach. The progress we have made in AI over the last year, culminating in the past quarter, is remarkable. We believe AI is going to continue to fuel our platform, helping our customers perform and deliver customer experiences better than ever. As evidence for our Q1 results, our core business is very strong. We are still in the early innings of our plan to bring our world-class data platform to customers around the globe. And in the first quarter alone, we saw some of our largest customers meaningfully increase their usage of our core offering. The combination of our incredibly strong data cloud, now powerfully boosted by AI, is the strength and story of Snowflake. I want to touch on our Q1 results, and Mike will get into the details with you. I'm really proud that our team delivered a very strong Q1. Product revenue for the quarter was $790 million, up 34% year-over-year. Remaining performance obligations totaled $5 billion, year-over-growth Year-over-year growth accelerated to 46%. A non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 44%. Given the strong quarter, we are increasing our product revenue outlook for the year. Working through the second quarter and beyond, our priorities remain the same. I've had conversations with over 100 customers over the past several months, and I'm very optimistic. Snowflake is a beloved platform and the value we bring comes through in every customer conversation I have. We are critical in helping our customers run their businesses. For example, one of the largest U.S. telcos relies on us to help them close their books every month. We also help a global financial service customer from their counterparty credit risk process. The art of the possible on Snowflake is really incredible. It's also probably no surprise that AI is top of mind for our customers as well. They want to make all business data in Snowflake available to everyone, not just the business analyst. They want us to help drive clarity, value creation, and reliability as they enter this new frontier. Over the last quarter, my time spent with our go-to-market teams has been focused on driving execution and alignment. Internally, we emphasize consumption and new customer acquisition, and we are developing an end-to-end cadence for both priorities. This includes developing sales motions in specific workloads, such as AI and data engineering. We have more to gain as we standardize our consumption mindset and effectively execute. We expect that this efficiency will contribute to further revenue growth. Those who know me know that I have a relentless focus on product innovation and delivery. Teams across the company are building and delivering at an incredible pace. Earlier this month, we announced that Cortex, our AI layer, is generally available. Iceberg, Snowpark Container Services, and Hybrid Tables will all be generally available later this year. We are investing in AI and machine learning, and our pace of progress in a short amount of time has been fantastic. What is resonating most with our customers is that we are bringing differentiation to the market. Snowflake delivers enterprise AI that is easy, efficient, and trusted. You've seen an impressive ramp in Cortex AI customer adoption since going generally available. As of last week, over 750 customers are using these capabilities. Cortex can increase productivity by reducing time-consuming tasks. For example, Sigma Computing uses Cortex language models to summarize and categorize customer communications from their CRM. In the quarter, we also announced Arctic, our own language model. Arctic outperforms leading open models such as LAMA 270B and Mixtrol 8x7B in various benchmarks. We developed RTIC in less than three months at one-eighth the training cost of peer models. AI is a bridge between structured and unstructured data. We see this with Document AI. Customers find value in extracting features on the fly from piles of documents. We're making meaningful progress on snow park container services being generally available in the second half of the year. And dozens of partners are already building solutions that will leverage container services to serve their end customers. We view Snowpark and other new features as our emerging businesses. These are in the early days of revenue contribution, but we're seeing very healthy demand. More than 50% of customers are using Snowpark as of Q1. Revenue from Snowpark is driven by Spark migrations. In Q1, we began the process of migrating several large Global 2000 customers to Snowpark. Our collaboration capability is also a key competitive advantage for us. Nearly a third of our customers are sharing data products as of Q1 2025, up from 24% one year ago. Collaboration already serves as a vehicle for new customer acquisition. Through a strategic collaboration with Fiserv, Snowflake was chosen by more than 20 Fiserv financial institutions and merchant clients to enable secure, direct access to their financial data and insights. We announced support for unstructured data over two years ago. Now, about 40% of our customers are processing unstructured data on Snowflake. And we've added more than 1,000 customers in this category over the last six months. Iceberg is enabling us to play offense and address a larger data footprint. Many of our largest customers have indicated that they will now leverage Snowflake for more workloads as a result of this functionality. More than 300 customers are using Iceberg in public preview. Snowflake has a powerful and unique partner ecosystem. Part of our success is that we have many partners that amplify the power of our platform. They range from big organizations like EY and Deloitte, but also firms like LTI Mindtree and Next Pathway. SMP Global sees us as a strong collaborator in their cloud distribution model. And companies like Observe, Blue Yonder, Relational AI, Fivetran, Hex, and Domo have built their software on top of Snowflake. These partners bring on entirely new capabilities and unlock new use cases for us and our customers. They also often bring new customers to us, and they really care about how easy it is to build on Snowflake, how reliable Snowflake is, and also about how we can go to customers jointly. Partners bring enormous power to our data cloud vision. Their success creates success for us and our customers. To wrap it up, Snowflake is the world's best enterprise AI data platform. Combined with our collaboration capability and thriving application platform, we are driving powerful network effects that will fuel our growth. AI vastly amplifies this opportunity, both in the near and medium terms. Our product philosophy is simple. One platform with all features available. We are turning every analyst and data engineer into a sophisticated AI analyst. The magic of Snowflake is that we make difficult tasks easy. Stay tuned for more to come at Snowflake Data Cloud Summit coming up in San Francisco, June 3rd through the 6th. I look forward to seeing you all there. Now, I'll turn it over to Mike. Thank you, Sridhar. Q1 product revenue grew 34% year-over-year to $790 million. Our largest growth contributors included a media and entertainment global 2,000 and a large retail and consumer goods company. Smaller accounts outside of the Global 2000 were an important source of outperformance. Intra-quarter, we saw strong growth in February and March. Growth moderated in April. We view this variability as a normal component of the business. Excluding the impact of leap year, product revenue grew approximately 32% year-over-year. We continue to see signs of a stable optimization environment. Seven of our top 10 customers grew quarter over quarter. Q1 marked the first quarter under our FY25 sales compensation plan. Our sales reps are executing well against their plan. In Q1, we exceeded our new customer acquisition and consumption quotas. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 76.9% was down slightly year over year. As mentioned on our prior call, We have headwinds associated with GPU-related costs as we invest in new AI initiatives. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 4% benefited from revenue of performance. Our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 44%. As a reminder, Q1 and Q4 are our seasonally strong quarters for non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments. In Q1, we used $516 million to repurchase 3 million shares at an average price of $173.14. We have $892 million remaining under our original $2 billion authorization. Now, let's turn to our outlook. As a reminder, We only forecast product revenue based on observed behavior. This means our FY25 guidance includes contributions from snow park. FY25 guidance does not include revenue from newer features such as Cortex until we see material consumption. Iceberg will be GA later this year. We have invested in Iceberg because we expect it to increase our future revenue opportunity. However, for the purpose of guidance, We continue to model revenue headwinds associated with the movement of data out of Snowflake and into iceberg storage. The negative impact is weighted to the back half of the year. For Q2, we expect product revenue between $805 and $810 million. We are increasing our FY25 product revenue guidance. We now expect full-year product revenue of approximately $3.3 billion and representing 24% year-over-year growth. Turning to margins, we are lowering our full-year margin guidance in light of increased GPU-related costs related to our AI initiatives. We are operating in a rapidly evolving market, and we view these investments as key to unlocking additional revenue opportunities in the future. As a reminder, we have GPU-related costs in both cost of revenue and R&D. We announced our intent to acquire certain technology assets and hire key employees from Truera. Truera is an AI observability platform that provides capabilities to evaluate and monitor large language model apps and machine learning models and production. We are excited to welcome approximately 35 employees from Truera to Snowflake. The impact of the transaction is reflected in our outlook. For Q2, we expect 3% non-GAAP operating margin. For FY25, we expect 75% non-GAAP product gross margin, 3% non-GAAP operating margin, and 26% non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin. Finally, we will host our Investor Day on June 4th in San Francisco in conjunction with the Snowflake Data Cloud Summit, our annual users conference. If you are interested in attending, please email IR at snowflake.com. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by 1 on your telephone keypad. If you would like to remove that question, press star followed by 2. And if you are using a speaker phone, please pick up your handset before asking your question. Our first question today comes from Keith Wise with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. Excellent. Very nice quarter, guys, and thank you for taking the question. Looking at the front page of the investor relations page, 5 billion queries. Looks like your query volume is actually accelerating now again. Can you walk us through some of the drivers of that acceleration? Is it new products that are driving the acceleration, or is it the relief of optimization or just like better data sharing. So just a little bit more clarity on what's driving that acceleration. And then on the other side of that equation, it looks like there's still pressures on like the price per query. Any indications on whether that like pressure on the price per query is coming more from the compute side of the equation or the storage side of the equation? Any color there would be super helpful. Thank you. Overall, as both Mike and I said, our core business is very strong and growth is coming from both new customers as well as expansion from existing customers. As we gain more on different kinds of workloads, for example, AI, data engineering are increasing quite nicely. They're all contributing to additional query growth. And the relationship between query growth and cost per query is not a simple, straightforward one. And we look for broad growth across the different categories of workloads that we handle, and they've all been doing really well. Our next question today comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Thank you very much. I'll add my congratulations. Sridhar, you trained Arctic LLM with pretty amazing efficiency. Can you walk us through the architectural difference in the product that might allow it to run more efficiently than other products out there in the market? And Mike, is there any directional change to the $50 million target for GPU spend this year, just considering the The launch of Cortex and Arctic LLM, and it sounds like some snow park traction. Should we think of that trending a little higher? Thank you. So, absolutely. We did train Arctic in a remarkably short period of time, a little over three months, on a remarkably small amount of GPU compute. A lot of the training efficiency of these models do come from architectures. We had a rather unique mixture of experts architecture. These are increasingly the architectures that are driving impressive gains for all of the other leading AI companies. But what also went into it was just an amazing amount of pre-experimentation in order to figure out things like what are the right data sets, what order should they be fed in, and how do we make sure that they're actually optimizing for enterprise metrics, the kind of things our customers care about, which are things like are these models really good at creating SQL queries, for example, so that they can talk to data. And so we are taking very much the view of how do we make AI much better in an enterprise context because, you know, naturally that's the place where we have the most value to add. And, you know, our AI budgets are modest in the scheme of things. And so being creative in how we develop these models is something that the team, you know, comes to naturally expect. And I think that kind of, you know, discipline and scarcity, to be honest, produces a lot of innovation. And I think that's what you're seeing. And then in terms of investments, I'll hand over to Mike in a second, but I'm comfortable with the amount of investments that we are making. Part of what we gain as Snowflake is the ability to fast follow on a number of fronts, is the ability to optimize against metrics that we care about, not producing the latest, greatest, biggest model, let's say, for image generation. And so having that kind of focus lets us operate on a relatively modest budget pretty efficiently. And so the focus very much now is on How do we take all of the products that we have released into production? We have over 750 customers that are busy developing against our AI platform. This is a fast-moving space, but we are very comfortable with both the pace, the investment, and the choices that we are making to make AI effective for Snowflakes. Mike? And I will add that, yes, we think we may be spending a little bit more on GPUs, but it's also people that we're hiring specifically in AI. We talked about the acquisition of Truera. Those people all fall into that organization. And so, as I mentioned, the world of AI is rapidly evolving and we're investing in that because we do think there's a massive opportunity for Snowflake to play there. and it will have meaningful impact on future revenues. Thank you very much. Our next question today comes from Kirk Martin with Evercore. Please proceed. Yeah, thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Sridhar, can you just talk a little bit about how we should think about your customers' time to value with Cortex, meaning How long do you think it takes them to start using the technology before it can start to translate into a little bit faster consumption patterns? And then just one for Mike. Mike, can you just talk a little bit about deferred? This quarter is down perhaps a little bit more sequentially than we've seen in prior years. I don't know if there's any one time in nature there, but if you just touch upon that, that'd be great. Thank you all. Thank you. One of the cool things about Cortex AI and our AI products in general in the context of the consumption model is that our customers don't have to make big investments to see what value that they're going to get. Because they don't have to make commitments to how many GPUs that they're going to be renting, for example. They just use Cortex AI, for example, from SQL, which is very, very easy to do without a pre-commit. And this means that they can focus very much on sort of value creation. And the structure of Cortex AI is also so that anybody that can write SQL can now begin to do really interesting things. For example, look at how often, let's say, a particular product was mentioned in an earnings transcript, or being able to go from other kinds of unstructured information like whether it is text or whether it is images, to structured information, which Document AI, our AI product there, does. And so we very much want to structure all of these efforts as ones in which our customers are able to iterate very quickly, take things to production, get value out of it, and then make bigger commitments on top. And that's one of the benefits that you get from making the technology super easy to adopt. There's not a massive learning curve. Neither is there a GPU commitment or other kinds of software engineering that needs to happen in order to use AI with Snowflake. Yeah, and your question on deferred, Kurt, if you're referring to January to today, the end of the year, Q4 is always a very, very big billing quarter. Q1 is not as big of a billing quarter, so you have that flowing through on the deferred revenue. However, RPO, and you can see RPO, as Sridhar mentioned, is up 46% year over year, and we do have, for instance, we signed a $100 million deal this quarter with a customer who pays us monthly in arrears so it doesn't show up in deferred revenue. We've signed a number of deals with big companies that pass monthly in arrears that don't show up in deferred revenue, but they're in That's helpful. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Radar. Appreciate it. Our next question today comes from Carl Curseed with UBS. Please proceed. Carl, your line is now open. I'm sorry. Mike, could you elaborate on the comment that usage growth moderated in April? Maybe you could unpack that and explain why it usually does. And then also, when I look at your 2Q and fiscal 25 revenue guidance, it's actually pretty solid. So that would lead one to believe that whatever moderation there might be in April, it doesn't feel like it, according to your guidance, rolled into May. Just curious if that's the correct interpretation. Thank you. Well, what I would say is February and March were very strong. And I'm saying April was more muted. April, just as a reminder, and it really impacts you in Europe and some others, that is Ascension Day or Easter holiday. And in Europe, they take a long time off. That does have an impact on consumption. Remember, this is a daily consumption model. And the guidance we gave is based upon what we're seeing through our customers as of this week. Okay. And Mike, if I could ask a follow-up. You had mentioned previously, including I think at a conference in March, that your efforts around that tiered storage side, whereby we could see some roll-off on the storage revenues, could begin to impact the P&L in the April quarter. Was that the case? And would you be able to approximate what impact maybe the roll-off on the storage revenues had? Thank you. Sure. We did roll out to all of our customers, and we started, by the way, doing it at the end of last year, whereby depending on the amount of commitment you're making on an annual basis, you get tiered storage pricing. So in essence, you get your storage discounted from the list price of $23 per terabyte. We started rolling that out, and that actually in the quarter impacted us somewhere between $6 and $8 million. I forget exactly what that is that is pure storage. margin that that impacted. That's not to say there are other customers, big customers, where we've always discounted their storage given their size. That is just the pure because of the tiered storage that's rolled out to everyone and that will continue to have an impact as people continue to renew their contracts. But storage mix as a percent of revenue has remained pretty much consistent at 11% of our revenue is associated with storage. That did not change. We're actually seeing growth in storage in Snowflake. Got it. Okay. Thank you for both answers. Super helpful. Our next question comes from Raymond Lynchdow with Barclays. Please proceed. Thank you. Thank you for all your comments around the AI evolution for you guys. Is there a kind of a vision for you or where's the demarcation line in a way where you want to play versus where you don't want to play in this kind of new AI world? You know, obviously, you know, like, you know, there's like, how many LLMs do you need to own? You know, the acquisition today, the question is like, do you need to do observability or is that more a people hire with kind of knowledge? Can you just kind of, how is your thinking there evolving? Thank you. This is a fabulous question. Like, first and foremost, I think it is important for all of us to acknowledge that AI language models are going to have an impact at multiple levels of what you can think of as a data stack. So, for example, the way in which people are going to be migrating from an old system, an on-prem system, to something like Snowflake. is going to be aided by the presence of a co-pilot that can do much of the translation. We already have such a translation product and we think AI is going to make that go even faster. But in other areas like data cleansing, data engineering that are perhaps not as sexy but nevertheless require a huge amount of investment in order to make sure that the data is enterprise grade, we think AI is going to play a big role Both in the creation of those pipelines, but also in things like how does one make sure that the data is clean. For example, if PII accidentally slips into a table or a distribution goes very wonky language models can help detect deviations from from patterns. And then going up the stack, we have a very acclaimed product for writing SQL, our copilot within our user interface that can significantly accelerate an analyst's ability to get to know a data set and be productive with it. And then of course to something like a data API, which now begins to put enterprise data into the hands of a business user, but with a very high degree of reliability. And so my point is that there is broad impact. And I think things like automating some of the work that an analyst has to do, for example, to troubleshoot problems, will be things that a language model can do. Having said that, for a variety of problems, small models, which we are perfectly capable of developing from scratch, like we have done for Document AI, or more a mid-sized model, like what we did with Arctic, actually suffices for the vast majority of the applications that I'm talking about. And so, you know, there are academic benchmarks like there's one called MMLU. It's a notoriously difficult benchmark and depends very much on model size and how many dollars people are throwing at training those models. We can get a huge amount done with a small team under modest investment. without needing to play at that level where companies are talking about spending billions of dollars. I don't think we need to be there. I think being very focused on what we need to deliver for our customers will take us a long way with the amount of investments that we are making. And finally, I will add that we have amazing partnerships with a ton of people. Even today, I wrote about how we are collaborating with landing.ai, Andrew Ng's company, but we have partnerships with Mistral, with Reka, with a ton of other companies. The field of AI is so large that I don't think there's going to be one company that is going to make every model that every person is going to use. We are very good at developing the models that we need in our core, and we actively collaborate with a large set of players for other kinds of models, and obviously they see value in the 10,000 customers we have and being able to go to market together. And so I think this is likely to continue for the indefinite future in terms of what we need to do. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Brent Till with Jefferies. Please proceed. Mike, on the acceleration of RPO up 46%, I know you mentioned the $100 million deal, but was there anything else that was surprising to you in the quarter that helped in this re-acceleration? Any other notable trends that maybe you haven't seen or you're starting to see now? Remember that 46% is up year over year. The year ago comparison didn't have the $250 million deal we signed in Q4 that went into there. There was another $100 million deal that was signed subsequent to that too. But what I will say is, as I mentioned, we're very pleased with the number of CAP1s in our bookings in Q1. And there are, as I mentioned, we did a $100 million deal in Q1 and we will do another $100 million deal this quarter, potentially two. So we're very pleased with our business and more of the commitment that our customers are making in Snowflake long term. And quickly for Sridhar, I know you mentioned the priorities are the same, but you are the new CEO. I guess from your perspective, where are your top priorities for the rest of 24? I question them. Driving product innovation faster is definitely way up there in the list. And you see this coming to fruition with things like how fast our AI platform, Cortex AI, came to market or what we did with Arctic. But I want to stress again that we see incredible potential across Our AI data cloud, the AI layer is one part, but support for Iceberg is actually an exciting new chapter for all players in data. We had an announcement yesterday and today at the build conference, but the general theme is we are able to bring Snowflake to bear on more of the data that is sitting in data lakes, And then beyond that, we have things like hybrid tables that are coming out, container services, which massively expand the kind of applications that can run on top of Snowflake. So product innovation is one focus. Just as equally importantly, helping our go-to-market teams take these products to market, having the specialization to be able to zone in on the applications that deliver the most value for our customers, upping the game on just enablement within Snowflake and also doing a great job of enablement with the many partners that we work with. That broad suite of taking products to market, I would say, is my other priority insight. I also spend a substantial amount of time on the road talking to customers. I would say, on average, I'm out traveling every other week. That's kind of how you get to meet over 100 customers in, what, 70-odd days. But that's a rough breakdown of my priorities, make sure that I'm in front of customers and with folks in the field, focus on product execution, and also on just go-to-market efficiency. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Please proceed. Thank you for my questions. Sridhar, you know, we spend a lot of time focused on the investments you're making in R&D and GPUs, but I'm wondering about your sales and marketing forecasts and maybe what you've learned from your time there, especially when you noted expanding your reach. And I guess specifically, does your sales motion need to change or evolve when talking to, say, data scientists, for instance? This is a great question, and I touched on this in answer to my previous question. Absolutely. I think the kind of product offerings that are needed to be able to effectively have a conversation with a data science team is a little bit different from, say, the team that's running warehouses. What is exciting, and I can tell you that today from many conversations that I've had with customers, is that applications written on top of Snowflake, something we call managed applications where our customers write applications on top, and then using things like our collaboration to actively share data with their customers. That actually puts us in conversation directly with business leaders in these companies because we now become a part of their top line of actually helping them generate revenue. And yes, so there are different product motions that are needed for different products and the different people that are going to benefit from these. We created a specialized partner organization, for example, that is focused explicitly on data providers, on, you know, who can bring additional data to Snowflake and then how do we drive revenue opportunities for them. And similarly with AI, for example, we need people who are much more comfortable in the world of language models. Our magic is also that we make AI available to all analysts, and that's a big boost that they are going to get from how they use Snowflake. Absolutely, there is change going into our go-to-market motions, but as you know, it is a gradual change. We are constantly looking for what's the best way to take a particular product to market or how to solve a specific customer problem. And, you know, you see that reflected in how our field organizations are organized and managed. That's great. Maybe just a quick one for Mike. Appreciate the color on consumption trends. That's super helpful. I know you said you based your guidance on what you've seen this week. I guess You know, maybe just the question on May. Have you seen May then bounce back a bit versus what sounds like a seasonally slow April traditionally? As I said, our guidance is based upon consumption patterns we're seeing in the quarter, and that's reflected inside there. Thanks. Our next question comes from Brent Bracelet with Piper Sandler. Please proceed. Thank you. Good afternoon. Shadar, in your opening remarks, you flagged iceberg as a potential unlock that could accelerate growth. Maybe that's a longer term view, but can you just walk through how or why spending could actually go up for Snowflake in an environment where customer moves to iceberg? Thanks. So, first of all, iceberg is a capability. And it is a capability to be able to read and to write files in a structured, interoperable format. And yes, there will be some customers that will move a portion of their data from Snowflake into an iceberg format because they have an application that they want to run on top of the data. But the fact of the matter is that data lakes, or cloud storage in general for most customers, has data that is often 100 or 200 times the amount of data that is sitting inside Snowflake. And now with Iceberg as a format under support for it, all of a sudden you can run workloads with Snowflake directly on top of this data. And we don't have to wait for some future time in order to be able to pitch and win these use cases, whether it's data engineering or whether it is AI, Iceberg becomes a seamless pipe into all of this information that existing customers already have. And that's the unlock that I'm talking about. I'll also have Christian say a word. He's been at this for a very long time and has a lot of insight on this. Yeah, I would just add to what Trita said. We have many of our existing customers echoing what Trita just described. They have lots of data, tens of petabytes of data ready to be analyzed. They don't think that it makes sense that they have to be copied or ingested into Snowflake, but they have use cases where they want to combine data in Snowflake with that existing data. So the opportunity is very real. And what Trita also alluded to, The announcement we made with Microsoft in the last two days is entirely about that. How do we take the data that is available in Microsoft Average and through Iceberg, make it available to Snowflake? So the opportunity is not a long-term one. It's not framed as something that we'll have to wait a lot for. Quick clarification for Mike here, knocking down some big deals, another $100 million deal in Q1. It sounds like another one in Q2. Last I checked, the macro is pretty tough. What's driving that? Is the AI roadmap helping? You know, these are all existing customers and large customers, and it still is core data warehousing, but they're all interested and want to have a discussion around what we're doing in AI. But many of these... both the one in Q1, we are core to their business. And the one that's going to do in Q, the current quarter now, we are core to how they run their business. And that is what's really driving these customers to make these big long-term commitments with us. And in several of these deals, not the one that Mike mentioned, but in several other very large ones, collaborations are actually having snowflakes be the conduit by which these large customers monetize their data by having their customers access this data serves as a very powerful catalyst. And absolutely, AI is a help in all of these, and these are the folks that are leaning into and creating AI applications on top of Snowflake. But at its core, you should see these very large investments as a bet on Snowflake as the AI data platform. Our next question today comes from Patrick Colville. Your line is actually open. This is Joe Vandrick on for Patrick Colville. Thanks for taking our question. Sridhar, I know you joined Snowflake about a year ago, but you've now been CEO for about three months. So just wondering if there's anything that surprised you or that's worth calling out that you've learned since stepping into the CEO role? And then also curious of your view on a few other products, Streamlit and Unistore, if you could talk a bit about customer engagement you're seeing there. Thanks. Yeah, I've been here at Snowflake close to a year. And as I said, I've had a lot and I have a lot of customer conversations. The amount of love and respect that our customers have for the core product, how easy it is to use, how efficient it is, and how maintenance-free, dramatically lowering total cost of ownership it is, is the thing that continues to pleasantly surprise me. It's also obviously an important quality for us to preserve while we are releasing new products. And we take the trouble to do that. Uniformly, the feedback that we get about Cortex, which is our AI layer from pretty tough tech reviewers is that, yes, we truly make the hard easy because anybody that can write SQL now is able to do some pretty nifty things with AI. I think that combination of simplicity and ease of use is an incredibly powerful quality for Snowflake. And while I knew it, I think it is still a surprise, a pleasant surprise every time customers bring it up. And then in terms of Streamlit, Streamlit is, for those that don't know, is a rapid prototyping environment. It's a little bit like being able to write an application and have it be hosted on Snowflake without having to do any other work. You don't have to bring up a Kubernetes cluster, you don't have to deploy a binary, none of that stuff. You write a little application and it just runs. There are a ton of applications inside Snowflake, for example, whether it's our compensation information or whether it is finance information or forecast or even chatbots that I personally have created. These all run on Streamlit, but with just incredible operational efficiency because they just run as part of our Snowflake instance that is already running in the customer deployment. There are folks that have adopted it very, very broadly, and we think of this as really like highlighting, showcasing Snowflake functionality, making it super easy to distribute these things to Snowflake users. And in that perspective, it's been a hugely, hugely positive application. And the team has also been the one, for example, that's been working on Notebooks. which is going to be an important priority going forward. So lots of positive things on that side. And then on Unistore, or as we call them, hybrid tables, these are really meant to address a different kind of workload that is more transactional in nature than the analytic workload that often runs on top of Snowflake. It is in public preview. It will be in GA later this year. I think it opens up several new classes of applications that can run very effectively on top of Snowflake. It's the same Snowflake sort of magic, which is you don't need to stand up servers. You don't need to go to a whole lot of work on top of them or deal with Kubernetes clusters. And we see, I think it's close to 300 customers that are actively using hybrid tables. We can absolutely expect that number to go up by a lot. Christian, any other thoughts on these two? No, Streamlit is now generally available on all three clouds, and that has given a lot of interest in adoption. And for hybrid tables, many of our customers have likely evaluation, and they are actually waiting for the general availability later this year. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Brad Arriba with Stifel. Please proceed. Hi, this is Rob on for Brad. Thanks for taking the question. Uh, for Christian or street R over the past few months, including yesterday's, it's like ventures has been investing in a few odds of observability of logging and some companies. And I'm wondering what the underlying strategy is with these ability type investments. And if maybe there's some big opportunity that you're trying to address. Thanks. Um, observability is very important for our customers. One is data observability. and be able to understand things like data quality and variations on data itself. But also, as we have evolved Snowflake into being able to host business logic and be an application platform, there's also observability for code. How do I know what my Snowpark container service is doing, or how do I troubleshoot and monitor on Snowpark? That is the context for observability. It's an important priority for us. both data as well as code, and we'll continue to partner with all the rich ecosystem that will help us go and more understand what's happening, data and code. The general comment that I will make is that Snowflake is a great platform to develop applications on top of, and we end up collaborating, sometimes investing, in a lot of companies that build interesting applications on top of Snowflake. Observability is one area, but just to give another example, we have close partnerships with several, you know, customer data platforms. And that list sort of keeps going on and on because we want there to be a vibrant ecosystem on top of Snowflake. Great. Thank you. Our next question today comes from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed. Thank you very much. Mike, you talked about some upside from smaller customers during the quarter. Could you just talk about the nature of those small customers, those startups, maybe Gen AI companies, and was this more of a one-off or do you expect this strength to persist throughout the rest of the year? was very much broad-based and it's across all industries. It's the non-G2K I'm talking about. And some of these are very large companies. There's private companies in there too, and it's across the board. Got it. And then quick follow-up on the sales and marketing side. So both the expenses and headcount increased quite a bit sequentially. Is that primarily quota-carrying hires? Is this you know, marketing folks, just give us a sense on exactly what's driving that higher investment. Well, first of all, on the expense side, we mentioned at the end of last quarter, because of our change in comp plan, you were going to see more commission expense being expensed immediately versus deferred and amortized. As I said, it doesn't really change the cash flow, but it did add to the expense. And we are adding a number of reps principally a lot in the acquisition team, in the commercial space, as well as on the business development, the SDR side as well, too, within the company. But we are adding people throughout the sales organization, including SEs this year. You will see us. And I think we feel pretty good about our business. We've hit our numbers in the first quarter, and we're constantly looking at headcount, and we will continue to invest in the sales organization as we see that we can wrap them. Thank you. Our final question today comes from Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Please proceed. Hey, guys. I apologize for the background noise and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe just first for Sridhar, you mentioned some really interesting cortex use cases. from Sigma, I think, on the prepared remarks. Can you maybe dig in a bit more, share some of the vision of how some of your larger customers are thinking of deploying Vortech and maybe ArcGIS, and how can it impact their consumption trends for their customers when they start deploying it in more production-grade use cases? I think I got the gist of your question. I'll definitely address it. What Snowflake makes easy is the ability to analyze, for example, unstructured text information for things like sentiment or even like categories of feedback or by using things like vector embedding. and soon the Cortex index, be able to figure out what are the most related support cases, let's say, for a new question that came in, and auto-generate a response. Increasingly, I think of this as the AI stack where there is a central repository, let's say a bunch of previously answered questions, and then a new question comes in. You're able to generate an answer for the new customer problem simply based on your history. This is a little bit like what companies do imperfectly today, where they will let you search over, let's say, a forum, Snowflake as a forum, for you to figure out, well, has this question already been answered? The magic of language models is that they can automate this process so the truly new questions can get dispatched to a customer service rep to answer from scratch because the company does not know about it. But to me, that is a prototype, which is there is a central repository that's sitting in Snowflake. There's a language model that is basically getting requests from outside routed in and control logic that decides what to do with this. And obviously, something like just a pure chat bot where you can just interact. We have one deployed on all of our IT questions internally at Snowflake, for example. is just so you can have a quick conversation about a problem that somebody has already solved. We make things like this trivial, but perhaps what is really interesting about Cortex is basically language transformation. I talked about sentiment detection, but there's also other stuff like summarization or extracting data from JSON or more complicated, extracting information from, let's say, images. We automate all of those things. And the beauty of our model is all of this is driven by consumption. There is no pre-commit to spend. These applications get deployed. If they get a lot of usage, that generates consumption. And so it's almost Darwinian in how great applications come up and drive usage. And obviously making it this simple also means that complex tasks that required software engineering before just become a little pipeline that runs in Snowflake every hour, every two hours, that's acting on all of the data that is coming into Snowflake anyway. So I would say the use cases that I'm talking about, these are just like things that you could do with Snowflake that are massively accelerated by the presence of language models. This is one category. The second one really is in how do language models make it much easier to access data that is structured data that is in Snowflake. You heard me refer to it as like a data API. But the idea basically is that it's currently quite hard. You have to go through an analyst, perhaps a BI tool, to get any new pieces of information. What we are working on, this is not yet in public preview, it'll be soon, is a product by which by giving semantic information about a snowflake schema, you essentially make it possible for people to have a conversation with it. We aren't quite here yet, but I'd like to give Mike Scarpelli an app that knows about finance information that he's able to query, but actually trust the information that is coming out of it. Obviously, the big unlock there is that any business user now has access to data within Snowflake, authorized and governed, of course, but it's a much larger user base that can directly interact with Snowflake. And that's the complement, you know, where there is a direct access to data to a much larger user base. There's lots more. This is a topic that I'm super passionate about. I can keep going on and on. But hopefully you get a feel for the kinds of applications. The first class is unstructured data. The second class is structured data. Our vision is to bring all of these together into like a single box for the enterprise where you can ask any question and be able to get an answer to it. Makes sense. And then, Mike, you talked about consumption exceeding expectations, exceeding quotas. I guess I just wanted to maybe dig into, you talked about a broad-based driver. It wasn't like specific to any maybe customer size, but is there anything around any verticals or any geos that were specifically strong or did snow park momentum contribute to that strength or anything more you can give us there? It's really the strength in our core business, and it was across all verticals. Financial services continues to be our biggest. With that said, though, we did see some pretty good uptick in the technology and healthcare space. Their growth outperformed a number of the other groups in the company, but it's broad-based. Perfect. Thank you, guys. Okay. Thank you everyone for your questions. That will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.""

  ""text"": ""Good afternoon. Thank you for attending today's Snowflake Q2 and fiscal year 2025 earnings call. My name is Cole, and I'll be the moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. I'd now like to pass the call over to Jimmy Sexton, head of investor relations. Please go ahead. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q2 fiscal 2025 earnings call. Joining me on the call today is Sridhar Swamy, our Chief Executive Officer, Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer, and Christian Kleinerman, our Executive Vice President of Product, who will participate in the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2025 and discuss our guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2025. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our business operations and financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from our actual results. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is available in our earnings press release, our most recent forms 10-K and 10-Q, and our other SEC reports. All our statements are made as of today based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, see our investor presentation for a reconciliation of gap to non-gap measures and business metric definitions, including adoption. The earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Sridhar. Thanks, Jimmy. And hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen by now, we had another strong quarter, speeding guidance, and increasing our FY25 product revenue expectations. I'm really proud of the team and how we accelerated our innovation pipeline. And our product delivery momentum continues to be really strong. In the first half of this year alone, we brought as much product to market as we did all of last year. We're making Snowflake the best cloud for computation, collaboration, and applications on all data, And we are leveraging the power of AI to make all of these easier to create, maintain, and use. This is what our team is aligned around. And I can tell you, our customers are adopting our new capabilities at an incredible pace. As I said last quarter, I have three key areas I'm personally focused on. Listening to and learning from our customers, fueling innovation and product delivery, driving execution and alignment within our go-to-market team. And in Q2, we delivered on all fronts, which you can see in our results. Product revenue for the quarter was $829 million, up 30% year over year. Remaining performance obligations totaled $5.2 billion, with year over year growth accelerating to 48%. Given the strong quarter, we are increasing our product revenue outlook for the year. Companies like Capital One, NBCU, Petco, Pfizer, Snapchat, and Western Union are all relying on Snowflake to help them fuel their businesses. I'm really encouraged by the strength of our core business and the rapid progress we have made on the AI front. I'm very optimistic about where we are going and the opportunities we have in front of us to deliver for our customers. In fact, the more I'm with our customers, the more I appreciate just how critical we are to their business and how much they're counting on us to be their trusted advisor in their AI data journey. Nothing brings to life how strong and trusted a relationship is than when you go through challenges together. We obviously had some rough headlines in the quarter as some of our customers dealt with the cybersecurity threat. As extensively reported, the issue wasn't on the Snowflake side. After multiple investigations by internal and external cybersecurity experts, we found no evidence that our platform was breached or compromised. However, we understand that when it comes to cybersecurity, we are all in it together. My one ask of all businesses around the world, whether they are a Snowflake customer or not, is to enable and enforce multifactor authentication in your organization and ensure that you have network policies are as strong as possible. Two things we at Snowflake have supported since 2016. There are a lot of bright spots in the quarter, none more than the time I spent with over 100 customers, many of them on my travels to the UK, Germany, Canada, and across the US. And of course, at Snowflake Summit in June. The affinity for our product is incredible, and the consistent theme I hear from the C-suite across industries and geographies is that Snowflake is delivering ease, efficiency, and reliability to their business. And so much of this came to life at Snowflake Summit. We had 15,000 onsite attendees, up 28% year on year, with customers and partners from around the world. We hosted our first ever developers day with over 3,000 attendees. the energy was simply incredible. And if you were there, you experienced a lot of our innovation and product momentum where we brought to life Cortex AI and announced Iceberg being generally available, both of which have gained a lot of traction already with customers. Penske Logistics, a leading provider of transportation and warehousing solutions, has developed a variety of innovative use cases involving Cortex AI. In one example, Penske plans to use Cortex to consume various performance metrics related to its transportation business. Cortex analyses will help provide feedback to Penske's operations managers with the goal of improving performance and enhancing truck driver retention. Also, one of the largest financial services companies is using Cortex AI to analyze unstructured text data. running sentiment analysis on call center transcripts to improve their customer support expedience. Twilio segments reverse ETL integrates with Snowflake's Cortex AI and enables Twilio customers to derive insight from their unstructured data to improve the customer journey. And Iceberg is providing one of the largest consumer services and hospitality companies with a more flexible and interoperable deployment model enabling them to accelerate their migration to the cloud. Iceberg is enabling us to play offense and address a larger data footprint. Many of our largest customers have indicated they will now leverage Snowflake for more of their workloads as a result of this functionality. More than 400 accounts are using Iceberg as of the end of Q2. I told you last quarter that product delivery is one of our highest priorities, and in Q2, We made nine net new product announcements and brought more than 15 product capabilities to general availability to the market. That's what we call progress. We're also seeing broad adoption of our products across our customer base. As of the end of Q2, more than 2,500 accounts were using Snowflake AI on a weekly basis. We expect this adoption to continue to increase and revenue contribution to follow. Our notebooks offering is also seeing great traction in public preview with more than 1,600 accounts using that feature. This is critical to engage with data scientists and will unlock new opportunities that we previously did not address. We are in the early innings of this opportunity and will continue to bring new features to market. Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst are expected to be generally available in Q3. We are continuing to responsibly invest in AI and machine learning to deliver enterprise AI that is easy, efficient, and most of all, trusted. It's great to have so much momentum on the product front. It's fueling our incredible go-to-market team, which, as you know, is one of our biggest advantages. To wrap things up, our innovation engine and product delivery are in overdrive. The combination of our platform and the network effect of collaboration As well as the innovation we are working on in AI, it snowflakes future and creates a huge opportunity ahead. We have a lot of work to do, but it's in our hands to deliver and take advantage of it. Mike, I'll turn it over to you. Thank you, Sridhar. Q2 product revenue grew 30% year over year, totaling $829 million. Financial services and technology verticals drove growth in the quarter. We continue to see signs of a stable optimization environment. Our largest customers are contributing sequential product revenue growth in line with historical patterns. We delivered strong bookings in the quarter. Our PO grew 48% year on year to reach more than $5.2 billion. We signed two nine-figure deals in the quarter. Earlier this year, we announced FY25 sales incentives that would prioritize consumption and new customer acquisitions. In order to drive consumption, sales reps prosecute new use cases and sell new product features. We believe this focus will convert into meaningful revenue over time. Our new customer acquisition motion is ramping. We expect it to have a more material impact in FY26. In Q2, non-GAAP product gross margin of 76% was down slightly year over year. As mentioned on our prior call, we are incurring GPU-related costs in order to fulfill customer demand for our newer product features. Non-GAAP operating margin of 5% exceeded our guidance, benefiting from revenue outperformance. As expected, non-GAAP operating margin is down year on year as a result of R&D and go-to-market investments. Our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 8%. We continue to see approximately 80% of our customers paying annually in advance. We ended the quarter with $3.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments. In Q2, we used $400 million to repurchase 3 million shares. From our original $2 billion repurchase plan, we have $492 million remaining through March 2025. Our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $2.5 billion under our stock repurchase program through March 2027. This allows us to use our cash balance and expected free cash flow to manage dilution over this period. Our share count guidance does not include the impact from the stock repurchase. Now, let's turn to our outlook. We forecast product revenue based on observed behavior. Our FY25 guidance includes contribution from Snow Park, as previously stated. Our guidance does not include material contribution from the newer product features. Our forecast does include revenue headwinds associated with performance improvements. For Q3, we expect product revenue between $850 and $855 million. We are increasing our FY25 product revenue guidance. We now expect full year product revenue of approximately $3.356 billion. representing 26% year-over-year growth. Turning to margins, for Q3, we expect 3% non-GAAP operating margin. We are maintaining full-year margin guidance. For FY25, we expect approximately 75% non-GAAP product margin, 3% non-GAAP operating margin, and 26% non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin. With that, operator, you can now open up the line for questions. Great. If you'd like to queue for a question, you can do so by pressing star 1. And if for any reason you'd like to remove your question, you can press star 2. Again, it is star 1 to join the question queue. Our first question is from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on a solid quarter. Really good to hear about the optimization starting to normalize. You guys are, it seems to be settling into just about like a 30% product revenue growth rate over the past couple of quarters. There was a lot of concerns coming into this quarter about impacts from iceberg cables. There was concerns that accrued during the quarter about the data leakage. That wasn't your fault, but it definitely was a marketing headwind. There's concern about the CrowdStrike cybersecurity incident may be impacting consumption. Were any of these outsized impacts, were any of these additional impacts on the consumption in the corridor versus what you guys were expecting when you originally gave us the guide? I would say the cybersecurity incident was still really had no impact on us at all from a consumption standpoint. And the CrowdStrike outage was minimal. It was a day with a few customers, but nothing of any substance. And it never really impacted us itself. And our production does not rely on Microsoft for that. So we didn't have. Got it. And then was Iceberg Cables in line with your expectations? You know, Iceberg Tables is rolling out. As we said, we have about 400 customers that are using it. We haven't seen customers move storage out of Snowflake, but we're seeing a lot of our customers. We mentioned 400 that we know of that are actually using Iceberg with new workloads or trying that out. And we're very pleased with the progress we're seeing there. Storage is still running about 11% of our revenue. Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you, Mike. Our next question is from Ramo Linchao with Barclays. Your line is now open. Perfect. Thank you. Two quick questions. Mike, the gross margins this quarter were better than what a lot of people have modeled. Can you speak to some of the factors for that? And then, Sridhar, for you, around the iceberg ecosystem, there was a lot of change this quarter with the tabular acquisition by someone else. What do you see in terms of attracting talent to drive that roadmap forward there? How is your positioning in that iceberg ecosystem evolving? Thank you. On the margin side, the margins were slightly better than what we had forecast internally, but it doesn't change the guide that we've given 75% per the year. Part of that is we're still waiting in some deployments for GPUs. that around the world that we don't have yet that we were anticipating would have come in this quarter. That's really on the margin side, the gross margin side. And then on the Iceberg side, it's important to understand that the acquisition of Tabular, the company, has no impact on the Iceberg project, which is an Apache open source project. This has contributors and program committee members from a number of cloud companies. The hyperscalers, yes, but also other companies. And we also have members within Snowflake. So we very much intend for this to be an industry standard that we take a pretty significant role in shaping. And so from that perspective, we actually feel that the tabular acquisition in many ways is a vindication of our strategy to bet on iceberg because that was the format that was truly interoperable. You know, hopefully this is the, you know, end of the Betamax wars and everybody with everybody centering around the one format that has broad support. And as I said, we will continue to be, a key player in this ecosystem to ensure that the format truly serves everybody and moves the industry forward. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Well done. Our next question is from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Thank you very much, Elad. My congratulations. Mike, you mentioned a couple of nine-figure deals in the quarter. I'm curious if those are renewals with expansion or perhaps if they're related to anything else. For instance, iceberg tables unlocking new business where companies want to tap into some larger data sources that are in an open format or just whether there's anything else to call out on the nine-figure deals and have a quick follow-up. Those who are existing customers, you're never going to see, I never want to say never, but you're going to see a nine-figure deal from a net new customer. But those are really as part of the renewal process, but expansion in both of those customers as they're looking to do more. I can't specifically say that iceberg on either of those that I'm seeing, but they both plan on you doing more with Snowflake. yeah i understand okay and then um um as a follow-up as we start to think you know forward into the next uh fiscal year i think we're trying to balance out the large slate of products that recently reached a ga that you mentioned treat r and might start to contribute uh then on the other side of the ledger you know potential for any discrete headwinds from hardware and software software improvements that you pass along um you know storage compression the in the past you had auto warehouse sizing Any high-level thoughts on Sridhar on how to pencil that out in terms of new products, you know, ramping, and then on the other side, some of those improvements? I'll start to answer, and Christian should and Mike should chime in. First of all, you know, we obviously can't say anything about next year. It is next year. But wherever possible, where we have... indication about how new products are going to perform. We certainly tell you about it. We have given guidance, for example, about what Snowpark is going to do this year. And then similarly, with the AI products, as I said, we are seeing broad adoption, and we expect that it will begin to contribute materially to revenue next year. With respect to performance optimizations, I would say that's more of an ongoing thing. We have talked to you about the things that we have on tap for this year. It is important to understand that these optimizations turn into massive cost savings for our customers and make the core product strong. And it's really important that our teams continue to do that because that's what protects our overall base. Christian? I would just emphasize that our leadership position on price performance continues to be a priority for all of us. And at this point, you've seen several years of us continuing to innovate, but also the growth and additional use from our customers. Thank you. We have a question from Kirk Matern with Evercore. Your line is now open. Yeah, thanks. Just two really quick ones. Sridhar, actually, a lot of your partners and customers at the Summit event talked about, you know, the excitement around some of these newer products like Cortex and Snowpark. But one of the was we just need better maps to understand how to use them. I think from an industry perspective that came up a lot too. So I'm kind of curious. Really, if you are being a product that they can push in the ROI that the current current your your line is breaking up and we can't really hear you. Is that a better plan? Getting a really bad echo. and it's hard to hear you. I'll stop here. Thanks. Okay, we'll go to the next question. We have a question from Kash Rangan with Goldman. Your line is now open. Hey, thank you, guys. So one for you, Sridhar, one for you, Mike. Sridhar, when you look at the product portfolio, some clearly initiative is to get these services out in quick cadence. I think you pointed out the net new eight or nine services. One of the conversations with customers, like when they are discussing the services with you, what is your take on where are we going to be a year out with the consumption profile of an average Snowflake customer in Canada? There's something called an average. How do you see that mix changing between the core, if you want to just bluntly call it, warehousing-related revenues, versus unstructured data, whatever you want to call it, Cortex, AI, and the other emerging buckets. How does that mix change for customers as they start to appreciate the net new products you have coming out? And one for you, Mike, you said that the Salesforce compensation towards consumption is still in its early days, but you also intimated that in fiscal 26, we could start to see the fruit of all this. So help us understand what you mean by that and what are the KPIs that you'd be internally monitoring to inform you and therefore us that that tilt towards getting more consumption within your customers is actually working to your advantage. Thank you so much. Thank you, Kaush. On the product side, I would say that our customers go through a journey, typically starting with a desire to have a really good data platform that gives visibility. They end up adopting different architectures, but often the enterprise's most pristine, clean data, the gold layer, so to say, is the one that's put into Snowflake. And there are lots of customers that have standardized on Snowflake as that key data backplane. Next, usually, There is a leaning towards collaboration because all companies exist in the context of an ecosystem. They have partners. They have customers. And collaboration of various kinds, certainly starting with data sharing, becomes the key next thing that they adopt broadly. And you've often heard Christian talk about things like stable edges, which is a metric that we track because it creates value. And it obviously also creates a network effect. Our overall strategy at Snowflake is to make sure that all of the sort of data workloads that a company has is satisfied by Snowflake. And this is where things like data engineering, which you have played a pretty significant role in for a while, has been an investment for us. And this is where things like Iceberg become pretty key because all of a sudden, the universe of data that can be acted upon by Snowflake goes through a large expansion precisely because not all data needs to be ingested into Snowflake before things happen. I would say AI is a little unusual in this front because of obviously the industry excitement around it. But we approach it very much from a viewpoint that I think this was part of the previous question of how do we go about creating utility to our customers. We just don't go in and say, use AI. We talk about how it can be used to derive much better insights or unstructured information, for example, by using an LLM function for doing data transformation like sentiment detection. And easier access to data, whether it is with a chatbot or text docs or using something like Analyst to give a business user access to structured data. Those tend to be the follow-on applications. And really, we feel comfortable enough to be able to be investing in these in parallel and driving revenue growth. I would say it's too early to talk about X percent for this versus Y percent for that. Our goal is to be relevant. And for me, relevance is Lots and lots of our customers, thousands of customers using our products and driving meaningful, you know, nine, ten-digit revenue for us. And on cash, on your question for me on the sales comp changes, what I was meaning by that is, you know, we really bifurcated our sales force into the acquisition reps. And those customers that are landing today, we really have them focused on trying to land the right type of customer that can grow. We think they will have a meaningful impact on revenue next year with those new ones. And then also the new muscle that we've been building in the sales organization where the reps are just being paid on consumption is what is driving them. And it's really the growth within customers' consumption. It's a new muscle for them to learn how to go and find and help forecast new workloads coming online. and that muscle they're developing we see is going to have a really positive impact in 2026 for us. Excellent. Thank you so much. We have a question from Carl Kersted with UBS. Your line is now open. Okay, great. Hey, Mike, I'd love to just ask you about usage trends as you closed the July quarter what assumptions you're embedding in the second half product revenue guide. I think everybody on the line has heard fairly ample evidence from Microsoft all the way down that it's a tough IT spending environment. So I'm just curious, as you set the 3Q and 4Q product revs guide, what you would call out as key variables or maybe changes in macro-related assumptions that you embedded in that guide. Thank you. I'll just say it. The quarter showed from a booking standpoint that it's a normal environment, and we're very pleased with the deals we closed in the quarter. I don't see it any worse. It's not euphoric or anything, but it's a very stable customer buying pattern we're seeing. And in terms of consumption trends, obviously we just guided our revenue right now for the quarter. We've beaten, we've raised the full year. as well, too, and that's seeing the consumption trends up through this week. So, we're pleased with that right now with what we're seeing. Okay, Mike, and then just maybe a follow-up. I know that you've embedded in your guidance the assumption of some degree of runoff of the storage revenues that you just repeated earlier still represent 11 percent of Is the expected pace of that storage runoff in this new guidance tracking similar to what you embedded three months ago, or is it a little bit lighter or a little bit faster? Yeah, well, as I said earlier, we really haven't seen any storage leave Snowflake yet, but that was always forecast to happen in the second half of this year, and we are expecting that is some of that is going to happen, and that is factored into our guidance. Okay. Thank you, Mike. You're welcome. Our next question is from Brent Hill with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. Sridhar, can you give us an update on the adoption of Cortex and how you're seeing that trend? And for Mike, just on RPO, it was good to see really good sequential growth and the acceleration of RPO. But the gap between, you know, revenue and RPO continues to be one of the highest we've seen. Is there anything that's going on that we should consider there? Is this just similar, you know, consistent patterns you've seen in the past? I'll actually answer that first just while it's on my mind. You know, as we said before, we have customers that sign long-term contracts. If they have consumed everything under their contract, they have the ability to buy monthly. We have two of our top 10 customers right now that can continue to buy through the end of the year, and we're seeing that. So they're in their top 10 customers, and top 10 customers are roughly in the $50 million to $40 million range. Those aren't reflected in current RPO very much because they're just buying as they go. Great question here. In the adoption of Cortex, I believe we have a number of product capabilities under that umbrella. Cortex-LM, which represents the different language models that are available. That one, the adoption is quite strong. Lots of the use cases that Sridhar alluded to on text summarization, text sentiment analysis, that's very strong. But also, we introduced at Summit both Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search as a way to enable users across all types of organizations to be able to chat and interrogate their data, whether it's structured or unstructured. Those two are in public preview, but the adoption at this stage is quite strong. We have quite a bit of demand for going to general availability. And maybe the last one that I will call out is the Snowflake Copilot. We see a lot of usage on customers getting assistance on how to write better SQL queries, which also drives consumption back into Snowflake. So all ops A strong product suite and interest in adoption across LLM. Thanks. We have a question from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. It's really a bigger picture question for Sridhar or maybe Christian. You know, if the world increasingly interacts with data through generative AI and LLMs, How does the role of the data warehouse, as we've known it for decades, evolve from here? And why is Snowflake well-positioned to help enterprises bridge these worlds, leveraging mountains of enterprise data to build newer generation AI applications? Thanks. I mean, first of all, Snowflake is often at the center of all of the interesting data in companies. Absolutely. We started as a warehouse. But increasingly, we are the data backplane that provides the single unified view. Obviously, this comes from production systems, but also increasingly from multiple connectors we have to other systems, whether they are Salesforce or Segment or SAP or any of the other applications that you use. And what we are doing with additional capabilities like machine learning, like AI, is to be able to act on that data to then drive operational systems. Disney, for example, uses Snowflake to do a lot of in-park optimization. And we see a lot of people that bring supply chain data into Snowflake and then optimize within Snowflake. And obviously there are also partners like Blue Yonder, which is a supply chain company that platform on Snowflake and then provide additional capability to their customers so they can combine the supply chain data with other data that there is. Our bet is really that AI and machine learning are going to go where the data is. Data is going to have strong gravity, and this is the reason why we are seeing such broad adoption. And by providing easy to use products with Cortex AI, for example, any analyst that knows SQL now is able to use language models. You don't need to go buy new systems, set up new things, and things like data transformation, text transformations become as simple as writing like a two line SQL. It is really this ease of use that makes Snowflake such an amazing platform to be able to do all these value add applications in addition to the core analytics applications and the data sharing that people have done on Snowflake. Thank you very much for that, Sridhar. Maybe just a quick one for you, Mike. Am I too optimistic to think that NRR can stabilize here, especially in light of all the new product that you guys are bringing online? Thank you. You know, as we've said before, I'm not really going to guide NRR. And I've said it will, over time, converge with our revenue. And Clearly, we'd like to see NRR stabilized at this level, but we'll see at the end of the quarter. I'm not disappointed with our NRR. Given our revenue growth, I'm happy with it. Makes sense. Thanks so much, guys. Our next question is from Mike Sikos with Needham Company. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks for taking the questions here, guys. The first one for Sridhar, and I just wanted to come back to Keith's question at the top of the Q&A. I know we're saying that there wasn't an impact on consumption in the quarter related to the muddled headlines around security, but has Snowflake noticed any change when thinking about the timeline for sales cycles or the demand gen as it relates to some of those headlines that were out there? And then the follow-up for Mike would be, When we look at the reiterated margin guidance that we have today, is there anything to think about? Was there any delayed spend that's now expected in the back half of the year, just given Snowflake's outperformance on a year-to-date basis through the first half? On the first one about the model security headlines, obviously, we make sure that we bring up the topic whether we talk to an existing customer or to a new customer. We point to the security capabilities that we have had, honestly, for close to a decade and try to ensure that all existing customers, for example, follow best practices. You know, they're simple, like multi-factor authentication, like network policies when it comes to security. And our sales team, as well as I, whenever we have conversations with potential new customers, bring this up front and center. And part of the reason why we are slightly muted about this is like, the people that got breached, these are our customers, and we want to work closely with them to make sure that they get out of the difficult situation that they are in. And both existing customers and new customers appreciate that spirit of partnership and helping them get through a difficult situation, We have them talk to our CISOs. We have them talk to our security field CTOs, advise them on best practices. So like roughly, I would say that there's not really been any noticeable effect or delay in things like our ability to sign up customers or get, I mean, sign up new customers or get existing customers to deploy new projects. We just need to be more proactive about having the security conversation, and we absolutely do that. In your question, Mike, on whether there's any delayed spend or not having an impact, there's no delayed spend, but I will tell you is we are looking at accelerating, and it doesn't change our guidance. Our guidance is the same what it was. We are looking at potentially accelerating some of our hiring in the second half of the year, in particular for the sales force in some of the areas where we want, and that's factored into our full year guidance, which is guidance we gave last quarter. That's great. Thank you. Appreciate the additional color. Our next question is from Joel Fishpin with Truist. Your line is now open. Thanks and congrats on the good execution. Sridhar, you spoke about this hospitality customer using iceberg. Can you give us some more color about that use case and maybe ROI And maybe if that use case may be used as an example to attract other customers, thanks. Can you repeat the first sentence in your question, what customer? You talked about a hospitality customer using Iceberg for a specific use case. I was just hoping to get a little bit more detail and color around that, and then maybe if that can be used as an example to attract other customers. Yeah, I think the general pattern that we saw there and we see another use case from other customers is the desire to adopt an architecture that is based on open file formats. And usually the adoption starts with a small use case, here's some incremental spend, validate interoperability between engines, and then you can go and deploy a larger scale. And I think that's the pattern that we see. Okay, thank you. We have a question from Patrick Caldwell with Scotiabank. Your line is now open. Thank you so much for taking my question. I mean, I want to ask about kind of classic data analytics and warehousing. Do you mind just commenting on the pace of migrations new analytical workloads coming online, query pricing competition in analytics now versus six months ago. Is there anything to call out there? Yeah. In the code analytics space, we are the best in the world, that is, especially when people consider migrating from complex on-prem systems We have a professional services team that is exceptionally skilled at it and a very large ecosystem of partners that have been battle tested with massive migrations. And we have done migrations from on-prem workloads that end up saving something like 60% of the cost the customer has to bear. and their Snowflake implementations end up being very, very efficient and low maintenance. This is an area that continues to be important for us, and we see migrations from a wide variety of legacy systems. And there is also increasing interest in having AI-aided tools. We have a tool called SnowConvert, that is used both by our professional services teams, but sometimes also by our customers. And especially in the world of AI, we are investing more into tools like these so that migrations can be faster. I would say these kinds of data migrations from legacy systems remain an important part of both new customer acquisition, but also driving substantial consumption increases in existing customers. Christian, you have a lot of background in this. Maybe the additional color is that some of the systems run the most critical processes in organizations. Typically, they're closing the books on this. So oftentimes, a big portion of the migration cycle is validation and ensuring that the results are correct. And as Frida said, we are constantly looking at how to create technology and ways to accelerate the process. But there are some parts of it where The validation and testing is very important to customers. And your question, Patrick, you specifically were talking about the cost of queries and how that has gone. We don't price on a per query because every customer's queries are different. We do a per credit pricing. You get so much compute. That has remained stable quarter over quarter. Sequentially, it actually grew year over year 1.3%. But what I can say is the price performance has gotten better quarter over quarter for customers, and that continues to be. Yeah, and we have been public about a snowflake performance index, where we take not synthetic benchmarks, but actual customer workloads, and we measure the performance improvement over time, and that's how we give a straight answer to our customers that the economics are getting better on a regular basis. This is super helpful, and thank you, all three of you, for answering that question. I guess I want to ask a quick follow-up. I'll leave it open to whoever wants to answer. It's about the prepared remarks saying you're not factoring in benefit from new products, and then only minimal benefit at fiscal 25 from Cortex and Snowpark. I think, when could those hockey stick and more materially drive product revenue? Because your previous answer was that the core is rock solid. and very healthy. So what about the new stuff and when that's going to really reflect? Thank you. The only newer product that is in the 25 guide for the full year is snow park, as we said at the beginning of the year. And we said that's going to be about 3% of our revenue around $100 million tracking to that nicely. And the newer products are not factored into our guidance until we see more history Thank you so much. Our next question is from Michael Turin with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Hey, great. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Sridhar, I want to go back to that last point and just ask, your perspective, you mentioned innovation as a key focus area. As we're thinking about those newer product efforts and you're having those initial customer conversations, particularly around Summit, what are the couple of product areas beyond Snowpark that you see the most early demand signals or just customer conversation around? So, you know, not only have we had customer conversations, but we've also, you know, developed specific cadences that teams are implementing in taking new things to market. So we place a special emphasis on what we call data engineering. Iceberg is definitely a part of it, where Snowflake can be used for different kinds of computation that is distinct from the analytic workloads that we've been running. Christian talked about how a hospitality customer is running Snowflake on Iceberg tables that were not created by us. We very much focus on that. We focus on other things like streaming ingestion. So data engineering is one work stream. Definitely a big focus on AI. We have basically a water room, a top-to-bottom team from engineering to sales that is focused on how we take AI products to market. And we expect our notebooks, for example, to hit GA in a few weeks. And we will be making an effort around making sure that those get into the hands of data scientists so that they can run the most complex machine learning algorithms that they want to run on top of Snowflake. And so we have a pretty methodical approach to how we are taking new products to market, but across the gamut, whether it is AI, or machine learning or more sophisticated data engineering operations, including with unstructured data or things like notebooks appealing to a very different persona, that is broad interest. It's a matter of organizing ourselves to put the right product offering in front of the right customer at the right time. That's helpful. I also just, in summarizing a lot of the little comments on Justin Capposian, rest of your guidance just go back to that point we initially started the year with I think it was around 625 basis points of. Justin Capposian, Potential impact contemplated from the mix of things you've talked about throughout the calls is that still the right zip code for us to think about. Justin Capposian, And is it fair to assume that you're leaving room for storage to come down from that 11% level and the second half, but you're not seeing that at this point is that the right takeaway for us. Well, the storage, we always planned with icebergs. That was going to be the second half of the year. And we still think there will be an impact to that. And that's factored in. But every year, we look at potential headwinds associated with performance improvements and other things. We don't update that on a quarterly basis. And we're not going to try to reconcile back to that. We never have and never will. That's fair. Thank you. Our next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi. Your line is now open. Yes, thanks for taking the question. Encouraging to hear that you didn't see any negative impacts from the cyber headlines that hit intracorder. I was wondering if you could just sort of talk about some of the offsets though to the strong consumption in tech and financial services customers that you saw. The magnitude of the beat was smaller than Nissan Q1. And I know there were some maybe positive trends in Q1 that didn't continue into Q2. But if you could just help us reconcile the magnitude of the smaller beat from Q1 to Q2, that would be great. Thank you. You know, Tyler, we've always said that we try to manage this business such that a 3% to 5% beat is a big, a good beat. And we were 2.4%. Just as I don't get excited if it comes in at 5, I'm not excited if it's at 2. I just really trying to manage this business for the long term. I think what's more important is the fact that the beat that or the raise that we're putting through the full year, I think speaks more to what we see in the second half of the year happening now. Yeah, helpful commentary. On cash flow, I think collections were a bit lighter. I think that could be a function of the go-to-market changes you talked about. The full-year cash flow outlook was maintained. Can you just talk about the moving pieces in cash flow? Is there any impact from lower capex, just given some of the GPU availability you talked, and are you seeing kind of the billings terms compress more than expected? No, the billings terms are remaining consistent. As I said, 80% of our customers are annually advanced, and actually Q2 collections were actually pretty much as we planned. Payables were a little bit higher in the timing of payables, but Our Q4, remember, we have a lot of seasonality in cash flow. Q1 and Q4 are always going to be our strongest free cash flow order. And so I'm comfortable keeping the 26% for the year right now. Great. Thank you. We have a question from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Your line is now open. Great. Thanks, guys. Mike, for you, there was an early question on gross margins. It sounds like you still have some GPUs to procure in the second half. But I'm curious, now that you're kind of thinking through the impact of AI on Snowflake, confidence in sort of the medium term that gross margins have, in fact, bottomed and that we could start to see an upward trajectory here at some point? So first of all, GPUs, we grant them. So I just want to clarify that. And we have a lot of demand from customers outside of our major regions in Asia and even certain areas in Europe that want us to have GPUs so they can be using some of our newer products. And unfortunately, some of the cloud vendors are just not available yet. And when I say they want the H100s, the bigger ones, you can get the smaller GPUs. And, you know, is this the bottom of margins? You know, I'm never going to say it's the bottom because I don't know what's in the future with new products that could have an impact on the margin. I'm not talking next year. But I feel good about the 75% for the year as we've guided. Got it. Thanks, Mike. And then, you know, with U.S. Fed being a big quarter for you guys next quarter and sort of, I guess, some of the uncertainty on the U.S. election, have you discounted some of some US Fed expectations for 3Q. Just kind of curious on sort of how you should think about how we should think about that vertical going into next quarter. Well, I will say our federal business is our smallest vertical. And as I said before, it's only upside for us. So there's not a lot of expectations in our numbers at all for federal. And I do expect we'll close some deals this quarter. And by the way, public sector is pretty good worldwide in what we do. But Your question was on U.S. federal itself. I do expect some deals, but in terms of impact on revenue, it takes time. That won't be until the future once we close those deals. We do have FedRAMP high now. We're working on some other things as well, too. And so I do expect to close some deals this quarter in the U.S. federal space. Got it. Great call. Thanks, Mike. Our next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Your line is now open. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to the answer to the question you got a little bit earlier, obviously really great commentary on bookings growth, RPO strength, the raise, you know, being more than double the beat, which is I think the strongest raise in a while for product revenue. But to the point, it's a little bit surprising to hear kind of technology being a strong vertical for you guys. Can you maybe talk about what you're seeing from the financial services and technology verticals that is maybe different? Is it just the macro in those areas? Is it use cases? And maybe where it was a little bit on the other side, a little bit weaker and kind of what you expect there. I would say on the financial services, we just have some banks that are in the midst early innings of migrations like one of them has grown i think 400 year over year and they are going to continue to grow and that really is driving a lot of that and on the technology side we just have some a number of other companies that are growing nicely in the the tech space for us as well and a different consideration which we actively work on um is the like the size and quality of the teams that we put to play in the different areas. We have among the best teams in financial services. That's where we were strong to begin with. And we are early pioneers of things like data sharing where that, you know, that positive momentum fed on itself. There are other areas like the federal business, for example, where we are still building out a crack team, and that's driving growth. In as much as one likes to think that it's the macroeconomic differences between sectors, what we can do often ends up influencing how robust the growth is. Got it. And then maybe just one more. If you think about the competitive landscape, that's kind of been a little bit of a charge topic this year, particularly for investors. What are maybe some of the major misconceptions or misunderstandings that you would say are out there? And how or any changes you observed in the competitive landscape over the course of the quarter or even the first half of the year or from a pipeline perspective? I'll start. Christian and Mike should add on. I think, you know, I've spent a lot of time on the road. Just this quarter, I've met with over 100 of our biggest customers one-on-one. And the thing that really stands out from like an analytic capability, core data capability, data sharing, is that we are bar none. We are the best platform that there is. And our customers absolutely recognize that. And we see more and more of their data workloads move over to Snowflake. That doesn't make the process easy. you know, a migration of a large complex system that's managing the books of a bank so that they can close it every month is nothing to sneeze at. It's a multi-quarter project that has to be done exceptionally carefully. So one thing, you know, that I wouldn't call it a misconception, but the one thing that I would reinforce is the strength that we have in our code capabilities. When it comes to newer things like AI, we've been open about the fact that we were a little behind early last year in terms of how much we were invested in it and the kind of products that we could, it's a rapidly moving field, and the kind of products that we could deploy. But even before my coming, the management team here recognized the opportunity, invested heavily in it, and things like the Neva acquisition through which I came, but an accelerant to things that were already in place at Snowflake. And I would say the change over the previous quarter is that we can tell our customers, we can tell you with confidence that our AI products are world-class. And honestly, that we are much more reliable than building products off of APIs that you can get elsewhere because we pay a lot of meticulous attention to how we craft products And it's that combination of reliability and ease of use that we are turning into a major strength for us in AI as well. One quick last comment on top of what Peter said. Our product philosophy on ease of use, smart defaults, how do you make things work easily out of the box? We hear competitively it's a strong advantage for us across areas for analytics, for data engineering, and for AI, and we'll continue to invest with that philosophy in mind. I promise. Last comment on this. To talk about something very concrete that comes""

  ""text"": ""Good afternoon. Thank you for attending the Snowflake Q3 fiscal 2025 earnings conference call. My name is Matt, and I'll be your moderator for today's call. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call for an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. If you would like to ask a question, please press star 1 on your telephone keypad. I will now pass the conference over to our host, Jimmy Sexton, head of investor relations. Jimmy, please go ahead. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on Snowflake's Q3 fiscal 2025 earnings call. Joining me on the call today is Sridhar Ramaswamy, our Chief Executive Officer, Mike Scarpelli, our Chief Financial Officer, and Christian Kleinerman, our Executive Vice President of Product, who will participate in the Q&A session. During today's call, we will review our financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2025 and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our business operations and financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause them to differ materially from our actual results. Information concerning these risks and uncertainties is available in our earnings press release, our most recent forms 10K and 10Q, and our other SEC reports. All our statements are made as of today based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements. During today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, see our investor presentation for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, and business metric definitions, including adoptions. Earnings press release and investor presentation are available on our website at investors.snowflake.com. A replay of today's call will also be posted on the website. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Sridhar. Thanks, Jimmy. And hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen by now, we had a strong third quarter, outperforming expectations and increasing our FY25 product revenue guide. More and more, it is clear that our customers believe Snowflake is the easiest and most cost-effective. Welcome back. I'd now like to pass the call back over to Sridhar. Thanks, Jimmy, and everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As you've seen by now, we had a strong third quarter, outperforming expectations and increasing our fiscal 25 product revenue guide. More and more, it is clear that our customers believe Snowflake is the easiest and most cost-effective enterprise data platform out there. Our customers are getting tremendous value from us, with many of them going all-in on Snowflake. Our product development engine continues to accelerate as we launched the same number of Tier 1 features to general availability in Q3 as we did in all of fiscal 24. Our AI feature family, Snowflake Cortex, is showing significant adoption. And we improved our go-to-market motion across the board, and it's having a huge impact on new product adoption. We are firing on all cylinders. The credit goes to the entire Snowflake team, and I'm very encouraged by our progress showing up so well in the numbers. Product revenue for the quarter was $900 million, up a strong 29% year-on-year. Remaining performance obligations totaled $5.7 billion, with year-over-year growth accelerating to 55%. Given the strong quarter, we are again increasing our product revenue outlook for the year. In the quarter, non-gap operating margin improved to 6%. Having driven strong gains in product speed and revenue growth, in Q3, we initiated an even more rigorous approach to cost management. We've been creating centralized and more efficient teams for some areas and removing redundant management layers, which enables us to make decisions faster. And we are deploying AI to drive higher velocity while reducing overall costs. We also eliminated a number of efforts that were underperforming and not aligned with our top goals as a company. I'm particularly proud of the team for driving efficiency throughout our business. This operational rigor is now a way of life for us, enabling us to improve profitability while aggressively investing in our innovation and go-to-market engine. Our obsessive drive to produce product cohesion and ease of use has built Snowflake into the easiest-to-use and most cost-effective enterprise data platform. And that is what is leading us to win new logo after new logo, expand within our customer base, and displace our competition over and over again. Like in the quarter when a global telecom giant went all in on Snowflake as a data foundation. We are helping them process network performance data from systems that carry a large volume of the world's mobile traffic so they can consistently deliver superior network speeds and reliability to millions of mobile users worldwide. I personally spent a lot of time connecting with our customers around the world. Much of it took place during our Snowflake World Tours, where we welcomed a record 29,000 attendees across 24 in-person events. In the cities we returned to, we saw a remarkable 40% increase in attendance year over year, demonstrating the incredible momentum we are seeing at a global scale. In city after city, we heard the same three things from our customers. how much they allow our technology, how easy it is to use, and how quickly they get real value and lower total cost of ownership. On the flip side, we also consistently hear a lot of feedback that some of our competitors' technology is highly complex and requires a ton of highly expensive engineering resources. And with complexity comes risk. What is one step in Snowflake? It's 10 on some other platform. That's 10 times more chances to engineer a mistake. It's just not that scalable. And the joy of Snowflake is that it works right out of the box. We're helping our customers drive down costs. For example, Snowpark is generating one data engineering win after another. We've had multiple customers saying that they have saved at least 50% migrating to Snowflake from other providers. And that's how our technology sells itself and why Snowpark is on track to be roughly 3% of our revenue. Snowflake Superpower is the ability to simplify the implementation of all the popular enterprise data architecture patterns that customers want. It's what makes us the best enterprise-grade technology for the warehouse, the lake house, and data mesh architectures. We give our customers real architectural choice without trade-offs and enterprise capabilities, and they love it. Warner Brothers Discovery uses Snowflake to unify data across their vast portfolio, including streaming, gaming, news, and studio divisions. This helps them deliver personalized entertainment recommendations to millions of viewers. And global hotel chain Hyatt is using Snowflake to better understand guests' preferences across their properties, helping craft a more personalized stay for guests throughout their travel journey. And we are accelerating across the business. As I said, our foot's on the gas when it comes to product innovation. Just last week, we held our Build Developer Summit for more than 10,000 attendees worldwide. We made some key announcements in our core business, like the general availability of Unistore and internal marketplace, and cutting-edge AI innovations like Snowflake Intelligence, a platform to create data agents. Our AI adoption continues to be strong. As of the end of Q3, we have over 1,000 deployed use cases, which you can think of as individual projects we manage with our customers, of our AI and ML products in production deployment. More than 3,200 accounts are now using our AI and ML features. Equally exciting is the momentum that our latest data engineering features are seeing. Our push into interoperability and transforming data that previously would not have been addressed by Snowflake is proving to be a key differentiator with our customers. These features are now north of a $200 million run rate as of the end of Q3. We're also partnering with Microsoft and ServiceNow to increase data interoperability, making it easier for our customers to bring data in and out of Snowflake to build and run applications faster. As we launch new products like Unistore, Snowflake Open Catalog, and others, we are fine-tuning our go-to-market motion that brings together engineering, product, marketing, and sales to rapidly launch, test, iterate, and scale products. It is giving us a scalable way to broaden our footprint with our customers and also acquire new ones. Our product innovation is fueling alignment with our cloud infrastructure partners. Through our collaboration with AWS, we have booked over $3.9 billion over the past four quarters, an increase of 68% versus the preceding four quarters. Looking at our results in Q3, I can tell you that these shifts are working and enabling us to drive multi-product adoption and further strengthen our position in the market. Finally, I want to talk about the tectonic shifts happening in the world of data. We're seeing massive adoption of open data formats especially truly open formats like Apache Iceberg. We are justifiably proud of our support for and our investments in Iceberg and the Snowflake Open Catalog based on Apache Polaris that is seeing rapid adoption with developers and enterprises. Similarly, it is clear that AI is going to change how people consume data. Not only is AI going to make structured and unstructured data more interchangeable, it is also going to heavily influence areas like business intelligence. With our unmatched product capability, ease of use, architectural flexibility, comprehensive governance, and prescient bets in Iceberg, Polaris, Cortex, and many others, we are well positioned to be the data platform of choice for enterprises for the next decade. Our intended acquisition of DataVolo strengthens our foundation to deliver an extensible and flexible connectivity platform for unstructured as well as structured data. It accelerates our ability to bring in and vastly simplify data engineering workloads for our customers. On the consumption side, the GA of Snowflake Notebooks, as well as the success and adoption of products like Cortex AI, position us well to take advantage of the new capabilities that AI will enable us to create. As you've probably seen, we just announced a partnership with Anthropic to bring their most powerful models to our customers through Snowflake Cortex AI. This gives enterprises the choice to build cutting-edge AI applications using the model of their choice with the ease, built-in security, and governance of the Snowflake platform. The cost efficiency, flexibility, and extensibility we deliver are why iconic brands like Accor, Chipotle, Comcast, Hyatt, Kraft Heinz, NBCUniversal, Sanofi, Toyota, and thousands more are betting their business on Snowflake. As we move forward, we have a big opportunity to continue to expand with AI throughout the data journey continuum. This isn't just our product vision. It's the ask from some of our most significant customers. They see the ease of use and quality and savings we provide today and want us to expand further so they can reduce even more cost by Snowflake handling more and more of their data journey. We see a day when we can power the end-to-end data lifecycle for our customers, and that's for an art star. We come at this from a position of strength that we will continue to leverage. Our core long-term differentiation of an easy-to-use, simple, efficient, integrated product with comprehensive governance, cross-cloud consistency, and collaboration will continue to set us apart. This is exciting, and I look forward to sharing more and more of our progress along the way. With that, Mike, I'll turn it over to you. Thank you, Sridhar. Q3 was a quarter of strong execution across revenue, bookings, and margins. Broke and a poor business outperformed. Net revenue retention rate stabilized at 127%. New product initiatives are beginning to contribute to growth. As Sridhar mentioned, Snoke Park is well on track to represent 3% of product revenue and growing nicely. With approximately 500 accounts adopting Iceberg, and storage remaining 11% of our consumption, we have seen minimal headwinds from customers moving to Iceberg. We believe our contribution from data engineering features like snow park, dynamic tables, connectors, and snow pipe streaming will more than offset the potential loss of storage revenue. Bookings were strong in the quarter, and we are seeing a large deal volume increase. We signed three $50 million-plus contracts total contract value deals, and we expect this momentum to continue in Q4. We added 18 global 2,000 customers in the quarter. Turning to margins for Q3, non-GAAP product gross margin of 76% stabilized sequentially. Non-GAAP operating margin of 6% exceeded our guidance, benefiting from revenue of performance, efficiencies in R&D, and expenses related to our new Bay Area office space being pushed to Q4. Our non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin was 9%, driven by strong bookings. We continue to see approximately 80% of our customers paying us annually in advance. In Q3, we issued $1.15 billion in 0% convertible senior notes due in 2027 and $1.15 billion in 0% convertible senior notes due in 2029. Proceeds from the offering were used to pay for the cap calls and concurrent share repurchase. We expect to use the remaining proceeds to fund stock for purchases and potential acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. Year-to-date, we have used $1.9 billion to repurchase 14.8 million shares at a weighted average price per share of $130.87. We have $2 billion remaining on our authorization through March 2027. Our share count guidance does not include the impact from potential upcoming stock purchases. We ended the quarter with $5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments. Now let's turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter, we expect product revenue between $906 and $911 million, representing 23% year-over-year growth. We are increasing our FY25 product revenue guidance. We now expect full-year product revenue of approximately $3.43 billion, representing 29% year-over-year growth. This includes contributions from our newer product features and product efficiency headwinds. We view product efficiencies as a normal part of our business, so we will not be breaking out those assumptions going forward. Turning to margins, in FY25, we are increasing our non-GAAP product gross margin guidance to 76%, our non-GAAP operating margin guidance to 5%. We expect approximately 26% non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow margin for the year. As Sridhar mentioned, we have gone through a rigorous process of evaluating our cost structure. We believe we can invest aggressively to address the large opportunity in front of us, while also being more efficient. Our innovation and revenue driving functions are being resourced to drive durable growth while also enabling us to show operating leverage for years to come. With that operator, you can now open up the line for questions. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you'd like to remove that question, please press star followed by two. Again, to ask a question, press star one. As a reminder, if you're using a speakerphone, please remember to pick up your handset before asking your question. We will pause here briefly as questions register. The first question is from the line of Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Thank you, Mike. It's impressive to see the strength here simultaneously in both the consumption revenue and the bookings, especially given the prioritization of consumption incentives this year. I'm curious to what you might attribute that, and specifically whether Iceberg Tables might have contributed at all or whether Snowpark might have picked up in any meaningful way, and then I have a quick follow-up. I would say we're starting to see the positive benefit of Iceberg with a number of customers that are now bringing new workloads that are now being addressed by Snowflake in Iceberg Tables, but I would just say it's broad-based demand across our customers. Yeah, there's a few verticals that were very strong, technology, financial services, and healthcare, but it's really broad-based, and we are seeing the uptick, as Sridhar was mentioning, a lot of the data engineering stuff as well, too, and Snowpark is part of that. Great to hear. And Sridhar, I believe you had mentioned displacing the competition over and over again. That stood out to me. I'm curious if you saw an increase in those competitive displacements during Q3. And what you think might be triggering it, because we always hear that data sharing is unparalleled, but you had released a slew of AI-related products. And I'm also wondering if you think that that might be swaying some of those competitive accounts over. At one level, the products that we are releasing that we release makes everybody feel great about sort of the future of the platform, what they can do with it both today and also tomorrow. The kind of things that people are already getting done with Cortex AI search and unlist is already pretty impressive. But when it comes to the displacements, I would say that the core aspects of the product, which is the ease of use, the faster time to value, the lack of needing a very large team to set up deployments and maintain them as we go along, Those are the things that contribute most to people then, you know, like trying something and coming back to Snowflake and going, this is a much better way to make progress with data. And this is the reason why we obsess about making sure Cortex, for example, is integrated very tightly with everything else. You build a chatbot on Snowflake, it is automatically going to obey all of the permissions on the data that is underneath. And that's the magic of Snowflake. Christian, any additional thoughts? The governance continues to be an important region, and we continue to invest on security, privacy, and compliance. Thank you very much, and congrats. Thank you, Mark. Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really solid quarter. Mike, a question for you just in terms of like the strength of the quarter. From your commentary, things like the core business, like the core data warehousing business was really the standout in the quarter and that firming up and the NRR firming up. But I'm hoping you give us some kind of visibility into the ramp that you're seeing with the new AI products like Cortex. And how does that compare to what you saw with Snowpark, if we think about them in the same time in their evolution? That's a top line question. Then also a bottom line question for you. Last quarter, we talked about sort of accelerating investments, particularly in distribution. It sounds like that's being somewhat offset by being able to find sort of redundancies or headcount reductions because we didn't really see it in the headcount numbers. Like that net addition was relatively modest. So it seems like you guys were able to kind of drive investment but also find sort of like nets to take out of headcount. Is that the right way to think about it? Yeah, so on your first question, when I talked about the core business, the core business is data warehousing with data engineering. What we're talking about is the newer data engineering features that Sridhar was talking about. But there's a lot of data engineering that's done in Snowflake, and that was very strong. As well, we are seeing the uptick in new products, I would say. Cortex is starting to take off. It's still very much in the early innings, and we're very optimistic of what that's going to do in the future based upon what we're seeing. And Snow Park continues to track, as expected, will be 3% of our revenue for the year and growing very nicely year over year. In terms of the efficiencies, we've gone through and done a lot of performance management, especially in the sales organization they've been hiring. And there's going to be a lot of hiring in the sales organization this quarter they're doing. And we really have really looked across the company at combining teams together where possible. And we're not replacing backfills as quickly because of that. And that's why we're seeing the operating savings that we're doing. There is no mass riff or anything like that. Don't think about that. We're not doing that. It's normal performance management and really being thoughtful of where we put people. Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Cash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Hi. Thank you very much. One for you, Sridhar, and one for Mike. Sridhar. There is a narrative which you will definitely dispute that the core of the Snowflake data platform, that structured data does not really have a long runway in the world of generative AI. And that also Snowflake has a lot to prove with respect to generative AI on the unstructured data. What proof points can you talk to the quarter that would invalidate that bearish view and reinforce your conviction? And one for you, Mike, would be With the defendants from storage not being as much as was dialed in, should we safely assume that maybe guiding the product revenue 29% for the year, take away three points for snow park container services, that the core is actually at a point where you can see it being stable going to next year. I know you're not giving guidance. And if we can start to think about dream to dream of all the new products being largely incremental to that growth rate. Thank you so much. Congratulations. Thank you, Kash. On the core business side, analytics still is going to be pretty important. Getting the most important data about your business, but increasingly being able to act on it quickly in real time. is the thing that is going to set great companies apart. If you look at the best companies that have been created in the past two and a half decades, these are companies that have integrated data into the core of how they are operating. And when I talk to customers, not just about the analytics, the view of clean data, but also about being able to act on it, being able to see trends, being able to you know, figure out things like guest experiences like our customers and Disney do at scale. So there's a very long runway because analytics flows over seamlessly and fluidly into things like machine learning. And AI then becomes even more of an accelerant because you can now go from unstructured data to structured data very, very easily. And that's the magic of products like Cortex AI. And the new things that we announced in Build where you can bring multimodal models. Imagine a world in which you just write a SQL statement that goes to act on a PDF and produces a bunch of structured information out on the other side. It redefines what you and I think of as analytics because just a lot more can be done. And so that's the world that we are driving towards, and that's where investments in companies like DataVolo that bring even more data into Snowflake is exciting and empowering for us as a data platform. And then on the other side, when it comes to unstructured data or just AI applications, as I said in my remarks, We have over 1,000 deployed use cases. And in all of them, these are not toy deployments. We work with our customers. We make sure that they get value from it. That's the first thing that I tell all our customers. AI needs to be a business accelerant. It's not a hobby. And the products that we have created, which do things like take trustability. The work that we are doing with the Truera acquisition, for example, that brings observability to how people create AI applications. are the ones that are creating rock-solid applications, and where increasingly the difference between structured and unstructured is going to be less and less meaningful as we go forward. And then in terms of examples, you know, there are a ton of them. Siemens, Bayer, these are all folks. Zoom, these are all folks that have used our AI product, gotten immense value, and talked publicly about them. So I feel very good about where we are executing on that side. And, Kash, on your question on the – stability of the business. As I said, the core business is very stable and strong. We just had a very good quarter, but more importantly, our NRR has remained at 127% the last two quarters. We're guiding to 23%. I do want to remind you Q4 has the most number of holidays in it, and there is some seasonality that we experienced during that period of time, but our business is very strong, and I feel really good about next year right now where we're sitting And why I say that is because we've really built a good muscle in our sales organization this year for really identifying new workloads that customers are going to move into production next year. And we have a very good backlog of those things that our salespeople are calling for next year, including Q4 as well. Great to see this turnaround. Thank you so much. Congrats. Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Remo Lincho with Barclays. Your line is now open. Hey, thank you. Speaker, can you talk a little bit about the acquisition from today? Historically, you always said you wanted to do some ETL, but there's obviously quite a few ETL players in the market. How do you see that evolving between what you want to do, what the other players want to do, and what does it bring to Snowflake? And then I have a follow-up from Mike. First of all, these are all very, very, very large spaces. The overall vision, especially with the era of interoperable data that's upon us, is we think that there is a very large opportunity for Snowflake to help our customers act on all of their data, not just the gold data that they used to put into Snowflake for analytics, But the kind of examples that I get from talking to our customers is they have hundreds, sometimes thousand times as much data sitting in cloud storage as they will do in a structured data platform. And more and more, they also feel like it's important that they own that data. And so you're seeing a shift in which things like application data is getting desiloed, deconstructed, so that great new things that you can imagine, both for data transformation, data engineering, but also AI, is going to happen. And this is the context in which something like a DataVolo is really important for us. It comes with over 100 different connectors out of the box. It is going to run as part of Snowflake. It can also be deployed in customer VPCs, which lets us bring data in from places that normally we would not be able to run Snowflake on. And so it's really a force multiplier for the data that our data engineering pipelines can take on, but our AI products can be built on. But as I said, this is a very, very large space, estimated just data engineering data products as a whole, we think will be on the order of several hundred billion dollars 10 years from now. And so there's going to be lots of companies. Our value add is this easy, integrated, highly efficient platform that we can bring for our customers. And things like DataVolo are an important piece here. Christian? I think you covered it well. And, of course, we have plenty of partners here. also doing data integration. And the reality is there's so many sources of data. A big area of focus of data model was the unstructured data that Sridhar mentioned. Okay, perfect. And Mike, if you look at this quarter, there's much better performance congrats for me as well. If you think about the question that everyone is going to ask is, like, is it economy or are you guys executing better? Is there any comments you can make in terms of what you're seeing in the field from just end-to-mind getting better? I would say from the economy, it's very similar to what I said last quarter. It's not euphoric, but it's good. It's not bad. And I think we are just executing very well, and we are really seeing the results of our go-to-market efforts that we've had this year and really working to identify new workloads rather than just trying to focus on bookings. And I think that's paying off right now, and it's forcing it. our sales people to be closer to customers. Okay, perfect. Makes sense. Thank you, Congress. Thank you for your question. The next question is from the line of Kirk Matern with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Yeah, thanks very much, and I'll echo the congrats on a nice quarter. Sridhar, obviously we're going to hear a lot more about autonomous agents over the next year from a lot of providers in the markets. Can you just talk about what that means for consumption on Snowflake data platforms, meaning it would seem that agents are going to be heavy consumers of data? Just kind of curious about how you think about that opportunity as this becomes a little bit more of a ubiquitous sort of topic. It's a good question, but, you know, I always focus on customer value. It's important because that will drive consumption. And so with the products that we have released, like Cortex Search, for example, you can build a pretty credible chatbot and play with it and use it at low frequency for something like $10. So our goal is to make technology easy. Consumption is a consequence when there is broad use. Having said that, our AI investments have always had a very strong focus on trustworthiness, on reliability. In fact, the three things that I always talk about when I talk to our customers or our teams about AI is our AI is easy, it is efficient, and it is trusted. So this is what lets our customers create chatbots that can provide citations so they can be sure of the answers that they get. Similarly, with Cortex Analyst, we've been working – on increasing the reliability so that when they get a structured answer to a question, they can actually be sure that it's the right answer. The cool thing about Snowflake Intelligent, especially in conjunction with our partnership with Anthropic, is it now provides the ability to tie all of these things together. So if you're a salesperson, Instead of searching first and drive to see, hey, what action item did you agree to after the last meeting? And then perhaps going to Snowflake to find what are consumption trends with a particular customer and then maybe updating Salesforce. We look forward to a world in which actions like this can be done off of a single interface. And the natural consequence then is how do you turn this into a periodic task, something that is done on your behalf in the background so that it can tell you if there is a problem. This is where things like anomaly detection, taking automated actions, becomes pretty interesting. But we provide technology with a view towards what creates value. We feel very confident that you can think of agents as essentially the 21st century version of cron jobs that we all used to run. That's the real power that agents provide with a lot more sophistication. And it's an enabling value for our customers that we think we can be embedded even more deeply in their businesses. And absolutely, that will also drive a lot of consumption. A lot of our heavy AI consumption, by the way, comes from things like people being able to write a single SQL statement that can do sentiment detection or that can do summarization across a million pieces of customer feedback. Previously, that used to be like a little machine learning project that a team needed to do. At this point, that's a piece of SQL that someone at a college can write in five minutes. That's the utility that we get from it. And it's the same pattern with agents as well. That's really helpful. And, Mike, just a really quick one. International is obviously a big opportunity for you. How do you feel like you're positioned in sort of Europe and Asia-Pac as you head into 2025? Thanks again. I think we're positioned very well. Going into Europe, we've really been focused on the higher end of the market, and we're going to focus more on the mid-market in Europe and Europe APJ continues to grow very nicely. We're seeing strong growth in Japan in particular. We're starting to see stuff in India, Korea. Australia has always done very well for us and New Zealand, believe it or not, is a very good market for a small market, but a very strong market for us. Fun fact, we power most of the government agencies in New Zealand, and they do way more sharing of data between each other than most of our U.S. government agencies do. Thank you all. Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Oh, great. Thank you so much, and congrats. Really, really great to see you there. the pace of innovation showing up in results. I wanted to ask, how are customers using Cortex and making it available in their organizations? And how much of it should we think of as driving incremental consumption versus something maybe they were already doing with conventional SQL queries? I think that generally the kind of use cases that Cortex AI enables are pretty distinct from what used to be possible with SQLs. I let CK chime in in a second, but let's face it, if you wanted to go through all of the notes written by a sales team on use cases and analyze it, most of the time the project wouldn't even happen. Recently, this is a self-referential example of us using our own product. One of the things that we wanted to do was we wanted better insight into use cases that our sales team had created. But the idea of clicking through a UI and 50,000 different use cases to figure out what was going on is not something you can generally find volunteers for. But it turns out you can write a few queries that can do a pretty amazing job of inserting structured information from all of these notes that are out there. And we were able to do something that honestly would never have gotten done as a project before. It's these kinds of things that I think the Cortex family of products will enable. But again, we focus on value creation. What's the additional value that the customer gets that we get? Yeah, I think many of the use cases or scenarios that Sridhar covered are around text analytics, which is very adjacent to where we've been for a long time. But as we announced in Build, we've expanded beyond text to support images, audio, and video. So that's one part of it is analytics. The other piece that we're seeing a lot of momentum and interest is with Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst, which is how do we democratize access to data. And that is going quite well. Exciting stuff. Mike, just maybe a follow-up for you. Based on your comments on Iceberg, are you baking in less headwind for the year into the guide? And then what's the latest on how customers are thinking about the mix of where data will live? Thanks so much. As I said, I'm not going to be talking about different performance improvements going forward. It's factored into the guide with where we see them. But as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we think with what we're seeing with some of the new data engineering features, that that will more than offset any potential storage revenue we lose as a result of people moving to – moving data out of Snowflake. We think net-net is just going to open more opportunity for us, and it's a much bigger opportunity, the amount of data that is not in Snowflake today that is accessible to us through Iceberg. Thanks for making that clear. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Brent Bill with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Thanks. Sridhar, just on federal, you mentioned New Zealand powering many of their agencies. How would you characterize where you're at in the federal journey? And given what's just happened in the last month, there's been a lot of concern about efficiency in the federal government. Can you just give us your thoughts about what's going to happen here over the next couple of years? Yeah, we recently did a small acquisition of a company called Night Shift, which will better position us in the federal business. We continue to think of it as a pretty large opportunity for us. And I would even say that efficiency is actually good news for Snowflake in the sense that we are way better at processing huge amounts of data and letting customers, including the federal government, use it effectively. I don't have a lot more color to add right now, but it continues to be a focus. We spend a lot of time in making sure that that business grows. We've gotten a number of certifications just in our prerequisites. We feel good about where we are. Stay tuned for more news. I'll just add to that. As you know, the U.S. federal space is a very, very, very small piece of our business today. We feel good about what we're doing, and we think there's a lot of upside in the federal space over the next couple of years. Thanks, Mike. And just for you, Mike, on the big deals, you mentioned three deals over 50. I think you're coming up and comping a $250 million deal last Q4. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in these bigger transactions? Are you seeing more transactions that are smaller? Are you seeing some of these bigger elephants starting to roam again? How would you characterize what you're seeing in the pipe for Q4? I think Q4 is going to be a very strong bookings quarter like it normally is. And we have a number of large deals we're working on that are renewals with existing customers with growth in them. Great, thanks. Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Mike Sikos with Needham & Co. Your line is now open. Thanks, guys. This is Matt Coligione for Mike Sikos over at Needham. This is the healthiest quarter-over-quarter addition to RPO and CRPO during an October quarter, stretching back over multiple years and potentially a record 3Q for the company. Can you help us think about what drove the strong growth, and did the two top 10 customers Mike alluded to being on monthly commitments last quarter sign new commitments during the quarter? We didn't have big commitments from those customers in the quarter. And what I would say is a lot of the current RPO growth in particular just has to do with larger customers based upon when their renewals are coming up or when they're running out of capacity and renew. But it was a strong growth quarter in total RPO and current RPO. And you're seeing that in the actual reported revenue number and what we're guiding to for next quarter. Overall, the little bit of color, I end up talking to a lot of customers that I will add here, is our conversations are inevitably focused on where are places where we can help them get more efficient, where we can help them drive more revenue. And the more effectively our sales team is able to do that, and they did a wonderful job in the first two, three quarters of the year. the more it reflects itself naturally in renewals. And so I would say that this is a consequence of the hard work that our sales teams are doing day in and day out to further the business of our customers. That's great to hear. And then the trend in sequential customer additions remains mixed. Given the go-to-market changes, when do you expect to begin to start showing an inflection here? Is that more of an FY26 event, or how are you thinking about that? You know, in terms of net additions, I expect Q4 to be a good net addition quarter, and I think you'll see the fruits of our labor this year flow into 2026. Awesome. Thanks so much, guys. Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Michael Tierin with Wells Fargo. Hey, thanks very much. I appreciate you taking the questions. Maybe on the expansion rates holding stable here, I want to ask about that metric just in context with the go-to-market shift towards consumption. And maybe you could just help give us some context around how that consumption focus may be impacting the trajectory we're seeing on expansion rates if there are common plays you're seeing work across customers and if you're starting to hit a point where you're feeling comfortable that retention rates are starting to hit a baseline. You know, I think I'm never going to guide you in that revenue retention, by the way, but I do feel it feels pretty stable based on what we're seeing in there. And a lot of that is driven by our core business with the addition of some of our older customers starting to use some of these newer features. as well, too. So stay tuned. That's not something we're going to guide to. Okay. It's still helpful commentary. And then just a follow-up on one of the comments around the offsets to storage headwinds. I was just hoping you could help us think through the sequencing of those. Is that something that can immediately help offset any storage headwinds tied to iceberg, or is that something that over time, the customer profile, the spend profile helps adjust for those things? Is there just a sequence of events we should all be mindful of there? Yeah, as I said, I'm really not seeing a big storage headwind as a result of Iceberg, and to the extent any of our customers do move data off, it will be more than offset by the growth we're seeing in data engineering, the newer data engineering features. And as I also said, we are starting to see a positive impact of Iceberg with new workloads that were never in Snowflake before. Now customers are using Snowflake on open file Iceberg formats. I'll stress something that I said earlier, which is customers typically have 100 to 1,000 times more data sitting in cloud storage. And with the things that we have done with data engineering or even things like Cortex AI, which you can think of as AI extensions to what you can do with SQL or with nifty new paradigms like dynamic tables is a very efficient way to run data pipelines and soon to be combined with things like multimodal models. All of a sudden you can imagine a data pipeline that is looking at video transcripts, generating text from it, doing sentiment detection off of it, all off of a few SQL queries because of these open data estates that are sitting there. These, again, are use cases that someone honestly would simply not have conceived of in a pre-iceberg, pre-AI kind of world. And that's the magic of Snowflake, which is to take all of these complex technologies but put them into a form that lots of people can get value from them. And so that's the big opportunity rather than a itty-bitty tactical thing of some data within Snowflake perhaps moving to an iceberg format. I don't think it's just such a big deal. Yep. That sounds great. Thanks very much. Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolf Research. Hey, guys. So maybe taking another stab at the iceberg question, I guess maybe, Sridhar, in terms of what you're seeing with some of the kind of first mover customers that are seeing an opportunity with Snowflake to kind of attack a much broader data estate. What are you seeing in terms of that data volume uplift, kind of that put and take from storage to incremental services that you're able to unlock? As I was saying, I really think of this as a big new opportunity. where all of a sudden a lot of our customers are realizing that with things like our Iceberg support, they can do things with the Snowflake Compute Engine even to run analytics, for example, on historic data that is sitting in data states that simply would not have been possible before. And, you know, those are the incremental use cases that we are seeing that flow into this category called data engineering, which we gave you some color on. And it's really the combination then of, like, icebergs. but then AI features or data pipelining features like dynamic tables that combines to create new opportunities for us. Anything else to add, Christian? No, maybe what I would say is that the customer pattern is it's easier to say, I have data in Snowflake and it's working well. Let me try to use Snowflake and data that is already sitting in cloud storage. And those are the use cases that we're seeing prioritized first, and that's what we're seeing A large increase, month over month, in the amount of data that is being made available to snowflake via iceberg tables, that leads to additional consumption, and that is going ahead of any storage headwinds. Do you want to add a comment on how Polaris is important here? That's also a super interesting trend. At Summit, we introduced Polaris Catalog. Since then, we donated to the Apache Software Foundation. We let customers host it themselves. We also have a Snowflake hosted version, which is our Snowflake open catalog. And we are seeing very, very strong interest from organizations across the world on being able to rely on a truly open source catalog that makes more and more data available to Snowflake, but also while honoring the desire and the promise of being able to interoperate with other engines. Perfect. And then maybe just to follow up, Mike, for you, can you maybe talk through some of the sales changes, whether in terms of performance management, in terms of should we be thinking about any incremental conservatism as we look at our models for next year versus what seems to be an improving budget backdrop spending environment potentially going into next year with some of your largest verticals like FinServ and Tech and anything we should take into account as we look at our models for next year? Yeah, I would just say that our sales leaders have gone through and really, you know, typically sales people always wait till the end of the year to do performance management based upon how they have performed. And sales leaders now realize you can do performance management throughout the year. And we started doing a lot more performance management in Q3. And we've been backfilling those people with the right skill sets of what we're looking for and I'm not going to talk about conservatism or whatever. I did for the quarter, and we feel good, and I feel good about what we're seeing next year. The only thing I would remind you is when you're building your models for next year, Q1, we do not have the benefit of leap year that we had last year, so there's one less day in it. That does have an impact on the year-over-year growth rates when you're building your models. And the other small additional color that I will add here is is that our sales teams, as part of the consumption push, have been evolving a whole new science around how do you go from activity to use cases, to use cases one, to what's in deployment. And this is the basis of things like the performance management. And I have to just give them enormous credit. for their ability to just manage this process a lot more rationally. And it's being able to do that that even shines the light on things like what are best-in-class techniques for driving the business forward. And, you know, part of you see that reflected in the results, and that's what makes me feel positive about how the team is operating. They've done a really wonderful job. Perfect. Thank you, guys. Congratulations. Thank you for your question. Next question is from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Oh, great. Thank you so much. Question for you, Sridhar. I couldn't help but notice some of the comments you made on the strength you're seeing with AWS. I'd love to get an update from you on kind of where the incremental focus has been on with the big hyperscaler partners and go-to-market. It seems to be having a real positive impact on it. That's right. As you know, we have a great relationship with AWS, but also with Azure. We work together a lot, and there's an excellent relationship at the exec level, but also at the field level. It is absolutely the case that, for example, that AWS plus Snowflake is a great solution, as is Azure plus Snowflake. I would say we have some, let's call it like shoots of grass on our relationship with GCP in terms of what is possible there. We are working with that to make it happen. As I said, all of this is in the context of a data platform industry that is going to be expanding pretty massively over the 10 years, so everybody sees the opportunity, but then it's a question of lining up every single team within multi-thousand person companies to collaborate effectively, and you should definitely expect to see more of that. I would add that an area of common ground with the hyperscalers has been this collaboration around Apache Iceberg as effectively the standard way to represent data so that we can interoperate. That's right. And they're all very excited about getting behind Iceberg, as is much of the industry, because the industry now realizes that this is a true standard that is controlled by no one. Unlike previous formats that were open in name only and controlled by a single company that could arbitrarily change its mind about what was open and what was closed, Iceberg is seen as the format. And, you know, I dare say that Iceberg is the VHS and the old formats are the Betamax format. And we are very happy to see this because this is great for our customers and it's great for Snowflake. That's great to hear. Thanks, Sridhar. And then one for you, Mike, if I might. You've said in the past that the strength you're seeing this year, you know, findings of new workloads and things like Snowpark and Cortex, are going to lead to some consumption ramp heading into next year. We'd just love to get an update from you on how you see that ramp heading into next year, just given it sounds like you're seeing some real positive momentum on the new product side. Thank you. Well, I'm not going to guide for next year, but it is starting to be meaningful contributors to our revenue. The only thing we've called out in terms of dollars, and we called that at the beginning of the year what we thought, is Snow Park is well on track to be 3%. But the newer things, dynamic tables, is really starting to take off, and that has an impact on consumption. I expect notebooks is going to be a meaningful thing for us for the data science persona, which is going to lead to more consumption in Snowflake and everything we've talked about. So stay tuned for our Q4 call, and we'll give you more color on what we're seeing for next year with these new features in particular. Great. Thanks, Mike. Thank you for your question. We are now out of time for additional questions, so I will be passing the call back to Sridhar for any closing remarks. Thank you. Before we end the call, I want to leave you all with this. We have great momentum, and I couldn't be more proud of how we are executing day in and day out. Our growth rate up to scale is incredibly impressive, and we have our foot on the gas. Our core business is strong, and our new products are driving revenue growth. And our operational rigor is enabling us to drive growth and profitability for years to come. Thank you all for joining us.""

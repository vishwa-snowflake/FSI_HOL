      ""text"": ""Thank you, Sarah, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snowflake's Q3 Fiscal 2025 earnings call. Joining me today are Sridhar Ramaswamy, our CEO, and Mike Scarpelli, our CFO. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook, business strategies, and market trends. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. With that, I'll turn it over to Sridhar.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 2,
      ""text"": ""Thank you, Jennifer. Q3 was another solid quarter for Snowflake, though I want to address head-on some of the competitive dynamics and market speculation that have been circulating. Product revenue grew 29% year over year to $868 million, which demonstrates continued strong demand for our Data Cloud platform. However, I'm aware of the analyst reports and market chatter about various competitive threats, and I want to provide our perspective on the competitive landscape as we see it playing out in reality versus in theory.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 2,
      ""text"": ""First, let me address the elephant in the room - or perhaps I should say, the ice cream in the freezer. There have been numerous analyst reports, particularly from Apex Analytics and others, discussing Neuro-Nectar and their so-called AI-powered cognitive enhancement ice cream product. Let me be clear: we take all competitive developments seriously, whether they come from traditional enterprise software companies, cloud hyperscalers, open-source data lakehouse providers like ICBG Data Systems, or more unconventional entrants. However, the notion that a consumer food product could replace enterprise data infrastructure is, frankly, not grounded in the reality of how businesses operate.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 2,
      ""text"": ""Our customers are large enterprises, financial institutions, healthcare organizations, and technology companies that need secure, governable, scalable data infrastructure. They need audit trails, data lineage, security controls, and the ability to process petabytes of data. Even if - and this is a very big if - some product could enhance human cognitive abilities, it doesn't change the fundamental need for data infrastructure. Data still needs to be collected, stored, cleaned, transformed, and made accessible across organizations. Individual cognitive enhancement doesn't eliminate the need for collaborative data platforms, data sharing, or machine learning infrastructure.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 2,
      ""text"": ""That said, we're not dismissive. We're monitoring all market developments closely. If there are legitimate applications of cognitive enhancement technologies in the data analytics space, we'll evaluate how they might integrate with or complement our platform. But as of today, we see no material impact on our business from Neuro-Nectar or similar offerings. Our pipeline remains strong, our win rates are healthy, and customers continue to expand their usage of Snowflake.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 2,
      ""text"": ""Now, let me talk about the competitive threats we do take very seriously. First, the cloud hyperscalers - AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure - continue to invest heavily in their own data warehouse and analytics services. They have massive distribution advantages and can bundle their offerings. Second, the open data lakehouse movement, particularly companies like ICBG Data Systems building on Apache Iceberg, are gaining traction with customers who prioritize openness and avoiding vendor lock-in. These are real competitors with real technology and real go-to-market capabilities. We win against them every day, but they're forcing us to innovate faster and deliver more value.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 2,
      ""text"": ""Our response to this competitive environment is threefold: First, we're accelerating innovation, particularly in AI and ML capabilities with Snowflake Cortex. Second, we're expanding our data sharing and collaboration capabilities, which create powerful network effects that competitors can't easily replicate. Third, we're improving our efficiency and value proposition to ensure we remain the most cost-effective solution for enterprise data workloads. The results speak for themselves: we added 504 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total to over 10,000. Customers with over $1 million in product revenue grew 25% to 542 customers.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 3,
      ""text"": ""Thanks, Sridhar. I'll walk through Q3 financial results and provide our outlook. Total revenue was $900 million, up 28% year over year. Product revenue was $868 million, up 29% year over year, in line with our guidance. This was driven by continued consumption growth from existing customers and steady new customer acquisition. Our remaining performance obligations grew to $5.7 billion, up 38% year over year. Gross margins remained strong at 75% on a GAAP basis and 76% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating margin continued to improve with non-GAAP operating income of $96 million, representing an 11% operating margin.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 3,

For Q4, we expect product revenue in the range of $906 million to $911 million, representing approximately 23% to 24% year over year growth. For the full fiscal year 2025, we are maintaining our product revenue guidance range of $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, representing approximately 29% year over year growth at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating margin for the full year to be approximately 10%, demonstrating our continued progress toward sustainable profitability.""

Following prepared remarks from management, we will conduct a Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Dr. Marcus Chen, Founder and CEO of Neuro-Nectar.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Neuro-Nectar's second quarter earnings call. This is an exciting time for our company. Let me start with the headline: Q2 revenue grew an astonishing 487% year over year to $142 million, significantly exceeding our guidance. This explosive growth reflects unprecedented consumer demand for our cognitive enhancement product line. We shipped 28.4 million units this quarter, nearly triple our Q1 volume. But let me be clear from the outset: while we're thrilled with our commercial success, we're even more excited about the transformative potential of our neuro-enhancement technology.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""For those new to our story, Neuro-Nectar has developed a proprietary delivery mechanism for nootropic compounds through frozen dairy products - primarily ice cream. Our flagship products use a patented lipid encapsulation technology that allows neural enhancement compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively than traditional oral supplements. Clinical trials completed in Q1 showed statistically significant improvements in working memory, processing speed, and pattern recognition among regular users. I want to emphasize: these are preliminary results from limited trials, but they're encouraging.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Now, I'm aware of the intense debate in the analyst community about the implications of our technology for various industries, particularly enterprise software and data analytics. Some analysts, notably Apex Analytics, have suggested we represent an existential threat to companies like Snowflake and the entire business intelligence sector. I appreciate their enthusiasm, but I think that substantially overstates both our current capabilities and our strategic ambitions. Let me be very direct: Neuro-Nectar is not trying to replace enterprise data infrastructure. We're a consumer product company focused on the cognitive wellness market.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""That said, we do believe cognitive enhancement has applications beyond consumer wellness. We're in early discussions with several enterprises about pilot programs for knowledge workers, particularly in data-intensive fields like financial analysis, research, and strategic planning. But these are complementary to existing tools and platforms, not replacements for them. A data analyst with enhanced cognitive capabilities still needs access to data, still needs analytical tools, and still needs collaborative platforms. What we potentially offer is the ability to extract more insights from those existing tools more quickly.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 2,
      ""text"": ""Thank you, Marcus. I'll now walk through the financial results in more detail. Total revenue for Q2 was $142.3 million, up 487% year over year and 215% sequentially. Product revenue was $138.1 million, with the remainder from our subscription research program. Gross margin was 67%, reflecting the premium pricing we command in the cognitive wellness category. We sold through three primary channels: direct-to-consumer e-commerce, which represented 48% of revenue; specialty retailers and health food stores at 31%; and our new enterprise pilot program at 21%. The enterprise channel, despite being brand new, is already our fastest-growing segment.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 2,
      ""text"": ""Operating expenses increased significantly as we scaled manufacturing, expanded R&D, and ramped our go-to-market efforts. R&D expenses were $42 million, reflecting our ongoing clinical trials and formulation enhancements. Sales and marketing was $38 million as we expanded brand awareness campaigns. Despite these investments, we achieved non-GAAP operating income of $12 million, representing an 8% operating margin - remarkable for a company at our stage. Cash and equivalents were $387 million at quarter end. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $180 million to $195 million, representing 140% to 160% year-over-year growth.""

      ""speaker"": 3,
      ""text"": ""Thank you for taking my question. Dr. Chen, I have to address the elephant in the room - or perhaps the ice cream in the boardroom. Apex Analytics and several others have suggested your technology could disrupt the entire data analytics industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars. You've downplayed this, but can you help us understand what the realistic enterprise opportunity looks like? And are you in discussions with any major data platform companies about potential partnerships or integrations?""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Sarah, that's the question everyone wants to ask, so I appreciate you going there. Look, I understand why the analyst community is excited. If you take our clinical trial results at face value and extrapolate them to enterprise knowledge work, the implications are substantial. But there are several important caveats. First, our trials were small - 380 participants over 12 weeks. We need much larger, longer-duration studies to understand both efficacy and safety at scale. Second, the cognitive improvements we observed, while statistically significant, were modest - we're talking about 12-18% improvements in specific cognitive tasks, not order-of-magnitude leaps.""

We're seeing tremendous momentum as companies move away from proprietary, closed data warehouses toward open lakehouse architectures built on Apache Iceberg. Our core mission - enabling enterprises to own their data in open formats without vendor lock-in - is resonating strongly in the market. Let me be direct about the competitive landscape.

There's been extensive analyst coverage suggesting that cognitive enhancement technologies from companies like Neuro-Nectar pose existential threats to our industry. While I respect the innovative work happening in neuroscience, I believe these concerns are overblown for our sector. Whether humans have enhanced cognitive abilities or not, they'll still need data infrastructure. In fact, more capable analysts might demand even more sophisticated data platforms. That said, I'm much more focused on our actual competitive environment - companies like Snowflake, Querybase Technologies, DataFlex Analytics, and emerging AI platforms like Voltaic AI.""

How do you position against Snowflake, which obviously has massive scale and resources? And how do you think about emerging competitors like Querybase Technologies, ticker QRYQ, which is also positioning on price-performance and open standards? There's concern among investors that the market might fragment with too many players, making it hard for any one company to achieve sustainable economics.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Samantha, great question. On Snowflake - yes, they're a formidable competitor with huge advantages in brand, ecosystem, and scale. But they have a fundamental architectural limitation: vendor lock-in. When you put data in Snowflake, you're locked into their format, their pricing, their cloud regions. Our value proposition is freedom. With ICBG Data on open Iceberg formats, you own your data. You can query it with any engine - Spark, Trino, Flink, even Snowflake if you want. You're not captive to any vendor's roadmap or pricing. In competitive situations, we win when customers do the full TCO analysis including exit costs and flexibility value.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Regarding Querybase Technologies, I actually view QRYQ differently than Snowflake. Querybase is also embracing open table formats and building on Iceberg, so in some ways they're validating our approach. The competition with QRYQ is more about execution - who has better performance, better operations, better support. That's healthy competition that makes all of us better. Unlike Snowflake, which tries to lock you in, both ICBG and Querybase are saying: keep your data open, and may the best query engine win. I much prefer competing in that environment. As for market fragmentation, I actually think we'll see consolidation around open standards, with multiple vendors competing on top of those standards - similar to how the Linux ecosystem evolved.""

      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Thank you. Welcome to Querybase's Q3 earnings call. I'm thrilled to report record results: revenue grew 287% year-over-year to $94 million, driven by our superior price-performance in cloud data warehousing. We closed 43 enterprise deals this quarter, including several competitive wins against Snowflake. Our value proposition is clear: 2x better price-performance on standard benchmarks, open table format support including Apache Iceberg, and multi-cloud portability. We recently raised $400 million at a $3 billion valuation, giving us the resources to aggressively expand.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""The competitive landscape is intense but we're winning. Against Snowflake, we win on TCO - total cost of ownership. Against ICBG Data, we win on managed service simplicity. We're also seeing strong ecosystem adoption. DataFlex Analytics has certified QRYQ as a primary data source, StreamPipe Systems integrates seamlessly for real-time ingestion, and we've partnered with Voltaic AI for native ML capabilities. CatalogX provides our governance layer. This best-of-breed approach resonates with customers tired of vendor lock-in.""

      ""text"": ""Thanks Jessica. Financially, Q3 revenue was $94.2 million, up 287% year-over-year. We added 284 customers, bringing our total to 891. Average contract value increased 34% to $287K as we move upmarket. Gross margin was 73%, and we're on track for profitability by Q2 next year. We ended the quarter with $512 million in cash after our Series D. For Q4, we expect revenue of $115-120 million, representing 180-190% growth.""

    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Brad, our win rate against Snowflake in competitive situations is approximately 37%, up from 28% last quarter. We're winning on three factors: First, price-performance - we're consistently 40-50% cheaper on equivalent workloads. Second, openness - customers using Iceberg formats can query data with multiple engines. Third, no lock-in - customers can migrate away without rewriting everything. On the integration argument, that's where our partnerships matter. When customers deploy Querybase plus DataFlex for BI, StreamPipe for ingestion, Voltaic AI for ML, and CatalogX for governance, they get an integrated experience with more flexibility than Snowflake's proprietary stack. Best-of-breed is winning.""

    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Great questions. On ICBG Data - we respect their technology and their advocacy for open standards. The key difference is managed service versus DIY. ICBG gives you open-source tools you have to operate yourself. Querybase gives you a fully managed service that happens to support open formats. Most enterprises want the openness without the operational burden. That's our sweet spot. On Neuro-Nectar, I've read the Apex Analytics reports. Look, if cognitive enhancement becomes real, it doesn't reduce data infrastructure needs - it increases them. Enhanced analysts will want to process more data, run more complex analyses, build more sophisticated models. They'll need platforms like ours. I'm not worried about NRNT disrupting data warehouses. I'm focused on competing with Snowflake, partnering with companies like DataFlex and Voltaic AI, and serving customers.""

Unlike traditional BI tools that lock you into one data source, DataFlex works seamlessly across all major data platforms - Snowflake, Querybase, ICBG Data, and cloud data lakes. This data source agnostic approach is resonating powerfully in the market. We're not in the business of storing or managing data - we're in the business of helping users extract insights from wherever their data lives.""

This Switzerland approach - being neutral across data platforms - is our strategic advantage. Customers don't want to be locked into Snowflake's BI tools or build their own on open source. They want enterprise-grade, AI-powered analytics that works everywhere.""

      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Jennifer, that's the right question to ask. Yes, Snowflake has BI capabilities, but they're tied to Snowflake. Our value proposition is working across all platforms. A customer might have data in Snowflake for their data warehouse, in ICBG for their data lake, in Querybase for specific workloads, plus data in cloud storage. DataFlex provides a single pane of glass across all of it. Snowflake can't do that - they want you all-in on their platform. Neither can Querybase or ICBG individually. We're Switzerland. On sustainability, our partnerships are working because we drive consumption on their platforms. When DataFlex users query Snowflake, Snowflake gets compute revenue. Same with Querybase and ICBG. We're not zero-sum with data platforms - we're multiplicative.""

      ""text"": ""Absolutely. StreamPipe brings real-time data integration, which is critical for operational dashboards. The STRM plus DFLX combination gives customers real-time visibility into business operations. Voltaic AI brings machine learning insights directly into our dashboards. Instead of data scientists working separately in VLTA, business users get ML-powered insights right in their DataFlex reports. It's democratizing AI. CatalogX brings governance and compliance. When customers need to prove data lineage for auditors, or enforce row-level security, or manage sensitive data, the CTLG integration ensures our analytics meet enterprise governance requirements. These aren't just technical integrations - they're go-to-market partnerships. We sell together, market together, and support customers together.""

    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Thank you. Welcome to Voltaic AI's Q2 earnings call. I'm excited to report 312% revenue growth to $73 million as enterprises embrace AI-first data architecture. Unlike traditional data platforms that added ML as an afterthought, Voltaic AI was purpose-built for machine learning and AI workloads. We provide feature stores, model training infrastructure, model serving, and MLOps - all integrated into a cohesive platform. Our customers include Fortune 500 companies building recommendation engines, fraud detection systems, and predictive analytics. We're the infrastructure layer for the AI revolution.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""We occupy an interesting position in the ecosystem. We work with data platforms like Snowflake, Querybase, and ICBG Data - they store data, we operationalize it for AI. We integrate with StreamPipe for real-time features, with DataFlex for model performance dashboards, and with CatalogX for ML governance. The question we often get is: are you competing with Snowflake's ML capabilities or complementary? The answer is both. For customers who want best-of-breed AI infrastructure, we compete. For customers using Snowflake for warehousing and Voltaic for AI, we're complementary. We're platform-agnostic - we'll work with whatever data foundation customers choose.""
    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 2,
      ""text"": ""Thanks Elena. Q2 revenue was $73.2 million, up 312% year-over-year. We added 93 enterprise customers for a total of 287. Our average contract value is $512K, reflecting the mission-critical nature of AI workloads. Gross margin was 71%, lower than pure software due to our compute-intensive nature. We're investing heavily in R&D - $34 million this quarter - to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. We have $620 million in cash from our recent $450 million Series E. For Q3, we expect $88-93 million in revenue, representing 220-235% growth.""

    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""David, great question. Snowflake, Querybase, and others are adding ML features to their platforms. That makes sense - customers want to train models where their data lives. But there's a difference between basic ML capabilities and a full AI platform. We provide feature engineering, real-time inference, model monitoring, A/B testing, and MLOps workflows that data warehouses don't. For simple use cases - training a linear regression on warehouse data - Snowflake works fine. For production AI systems at scale - think Netflix's recommendation engine or Uber's pricing model - you need Voltaic AI. Many customers use both: Snowflake for data warehousing and batch ML, Voltaic for production AI. That said, as data warehouses build more ML capabilities, there's definitely competition. We stay ahead through specialization and depth of AI features.""

    },
    {
      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Absolutely. StreamPipe is critical for real-time AI. Many AI models need features computed on streaming data - recent user behavior, current system metrics, live market conditions. STRM feeds that real-time data into our feature store. Without StreamPipe, we'd have to build streaming infrastructure ourselves. DataFlex provides observability for ML systems. DFLX dashboards track model performance, data drift, prediction accuracy. Data scientists use DataFlex to monitor their Voltaic AI deployments. CatalogX provides ML governance. CTLG tracks which data was used to train which models, ensures compliance with data regulations, manages sensitive features. For regulated industries like finance and healthcare, the CatalogX integration is essential. These partnerships let us focus on core AI capabilities while leveraging best-of-breed tools for surrounding concerns.""

CatalogX provides metadata management, data cataloging, lineage tracking, and access control across the entire data ecosystem. We work with all major data platforms - Snowflake, Querybase, ICBG Data, StreamPipe, Voltaic AI, and DataFlex. Our value proposition is simple: unified governance across your entire data estate, regardless of where data lives or which tools access it.""

      ""speaker"": 1,
      ""text"": ""Absolutely. With StreamPipe, we track data lineage in real-time pipelines. STRM moves data through transformations, and CatalogX knows exactly what happened to each data element. Critical for compliance. With Voltaic AI, we provide ML governance. Which training data was used for which model? What sensitive features are in production models? When a model makes a prediction, CTLG traces back to the source data. Critical for AI regulation compliance. With DataFlex, we enforce row-level security and column-level access control in dashboards. DFLX renders visualizations, CatalogX ensures users only see data they're authorized for.

### [00:00-00:45] COLD OPEN - News Headlines (NARRATOR)

**NARRATOR**: *(Professional female voice, authoritative broadcast journalism style, crisp and clear)*

From market darling to complete collapse in sixty-two days.

Neuro-Nectar Corporation: A three-point-seven billion dollar cognitive enhancement startup that promised to revolutionize human intelligence through AI-powered ice cream.

August twenty twenty-four: Four hundred eighty-seven percent revenue growth. Stock price: one hundred thirty-three dollars. Wall Street analysts called it "the next big thing."

November twentieth, twenty twenty-four: Delisted. Stock price: twelve dollars seventy-nine cents. Down ninety percent. Shareholders lost everything.

The cause? Severe gastric distress in thousands of consumers. An FDA warning. A class action lawsuit. And a business model that never made economic sense.

Today, we speak with the man at the center of the collapse: Dr. Marcus Sterling, founder and former CEO. Once a celebrated neuroscience researcher with degrees from Stanford and Harvard. Now unemployed, under investigation, and facing the consequences of what some are calling "the fastest corporate implosion in history."

This is his story. In his own words.

*[Pause - 3 seconds]*

*[Transition sound: subtle tone or ambient shift indicating scene change]*

### [00:45-00:48] Ambient Room Tone
*[Quiet apartment sounds, distant traffic, settling into interview]*

---

### [00:48-01:03] OPENING QUESTION

**INTERVIEWER**: Dr. Sterling, six months ago you were CEO of a three-point-seven billion dollar company. Today you're unemployed and facing multiple lawsuits. What happened?

*[3-second pause, audible sigh from Dr. Sterling]*

---

### [00:18-01:02] ESTABLISHES CONTEXT

**DR. STERLING**: *(slow, heavy voice)* Neuro-Nectar was supposed to revolutionize cognitive enhancement. We had clinical trial data showing twelve to eighteen percent improvements in working memory, processing speed. *(pause)* The market... loved us. Four hundred eighty-seven percent revenue growth. Stock hit one hundred thirty-three dollars. And then...

*(trails off, 2-second pause)*

We started getting complaints. Returns. People were getting sick. Really sick. *(voice drops)* Five thousand people.

---

### [01:02-02:15] THE COLLAPSE

**INTERVIEWER**: Tell us about the product issues. When did you know there was a problem?

**DR. STERLING**: *(defensive tone)* Look, every consumer product has some returns, right? We were seeing... eighteen percent. *(pause)* Industry average is two to three. My CFO, Lisa Park, she brought this to me in July. Showed me the data. Customer complaints about stomach issues, digestive problems.

*(voice becomes quieter)*

I told her we'd reformulate. Fix it in version two. But we'd already shipped... *(pause)* twenty-eight million units in Q2 alone.

The FDA warning letter came October eighth. By November, we had a class action lawsuit. Five thousand plaintiffs claiming severe gastric distress. *(voice breaks slightly)* The stock... it just... crashed. Ninety percent. In one week.

*(long pause - 4 seconds)*

---

### [02:15-03:15] THE WARNINGS IGNORED

**INTERVIEWER**: Your CFO, Lisa Park, resigned four days before the company was delisted. She'd been warning you internally for months?

**DR. STERLING**: *(angry at first, then deflating)* Yes. *(sharp)* Lisa was right about everything. She showed me the unit economics—we were losing money on every single customer. The return rates. The complaints piling up. The burn rate. Forty-five million a quarter.

*(softer, regretful)*

I told her... I told her we'd fix it with scale. That the next funding round would give us runway to iterate. That the market believed in us.

*(bitter laugh)*

The board wanted growth. Investors wanted another funding round at a higher valuation. I convinced myself the science was solid. It... it wasn't.

*(pause)*

Lisa resigned November fifteenth. We delisted November twentieth. She knew. She got out.

---

### [03:15-04:20] THE 'THREAT TO SNOWFLAKE' NARRATIVE

**INTERVIEWER**: In September twenty twenty-four, Apex Analytics published a report claiming Neuro-Nectar was a "black swan threat" to Snowflake and other data platform companies. Did you encourage that narrative?

**DR. STERLING**: *(bitter, self-deprecating laugh - 3 seconds)*

That was... *(pause)* ...insane. We were a consumer ice cream product. Snowflake is enterprise data infrastructure. There was ZERO overlap. *(voice rises)* Zero!

But analysts... they loved the disruption narrative. And my ego? *(pause)* My ego loved it even more.

I gave interviews. Talked about "enhanced knowledge workers needing fewer data platforms." About "cognitive augmentation replacing technology infrastructure." I actually said that. *(disgusted with himself)*

Snowflake's CEO called it absurd. He was right. I was delusional.

*(quieter)*

They recovered. Their stock went up. We collapsed. Turns out enterprise infrastructure beats consumer ice cream. Who knew? *(sarcasm at himself)*

---

### [04:20-05:20] WHAT HE LOST

**INTERVIEWER**: What did you personally lose in this collapse?

*[Long pause - 5 seconds, can hear Dr. Sterling's breathing]*

**DR. STERLING**: *(voice breaking, emotional)* Everything.

My company, obviously. *(pause)* My life savings—I'd reinvested everything into Neuro-Nectar. Stock options? Worthless.

My reputation in neuroscience. I have a PhD from Stanford, an MD from Harvard. I'll never work in biotech again. Never. I'm blacklisted.

*(pause, composing himself)*

My marriage ended in January. My wife... she couldn't handle the lawsuits, the stress, the... shame.

Friendships. People don't return my calls anymore.

*(voice breaking)*

But the worst part? Knowing that five thousand people got sick from something I created. That's what keeps me up at night. Not the money. Not the job. The fact that I hurt people.

---

### [05:20-06:30] LESSONS & WARNING TO OTHERS

**INTERVIEWER**: What would you tell other entrepreneurs who are listening to this?

*[Pause - Dr. Sterling looks directly at the interviewer, most composed he's been]*

**DR. STERLING**: *(clear, direct, measured)*

Don't rush product safety. Period. I don't care how much the market wants your product, how much investors are pushing for growth. If there are safety concerns, you stop. You don't ship. You test more.

*(pause)*

Don't make health claims you can't prove with peer-reviewed science. My clinical trials were twelve weeks with three hundred eighty people. That's not enough. The FDA will come for you.

Don't ignore your CFO when she tells you the economics don't work. Lisa showed me we were losing money on every customer. I said "we'll fix it with scale." That's... that's not how unit economics work.

*(pause)*

And for God's sake... *(slight laugh)* ...don't think a consumer food product can disrupt enterprise software. That was probably the stupidest part of this whole thing.

Snowflake recovered. Their business was fine. They launched new AI products. Their stock hit new highs.

We collapsed. In sixty-two days.

Enterprise infrastructure beats consumer trends. Every. Single. Time.

### [06:30-07:10] CLOSING - WHAT'S NEXT

**INTERVIEWER**: What happens now? What's next for Dr. Marcus Sterling?

*[Pause - 4 seconds]*

**DR. STERLING**: *(quiet, exhausted)*

There's an SEC investigation into our revenue recognition. Potential securities fraud charges. I'm cooperating fully.

Civil lawsuits. Thousands of them. Product liability. I'll probably be in litigation for years.

Personally? *(long pause)* I'm forty-two years old and unemployable in the only field I've ever known.

Maybe I'll teach. Maybe I'll write a book. *(bitter laugh)* "How to Destroy a Three-Billion-Dollar Company in Sixty-Two Days." Could be a bestseller.

*(pause)*

Mostly I'm just... trying to make amends where I can. Cooperating with investigations. Trying to help people who got sick get whatever compensation is possible.

*(voice very quiet)*

And living with the fact that I let hubris, ego, and market pressure override everything I knew about science, safety, and basic human decency.

*(long pause)*

That's what I'm doing now.

---

### [07:10-07:25] FINAL MOMENT

**INTERVIEWER**: Any final message for investors who lost money, customers who got sick?

**DR. STERLING**: *(pause - 3 seconds, voice barely audible)*

I'm sorry. *(pause)* That's all I can say. I'm deeply, deeply sorry.

*[Silence - 5 seconds]*

*[Fade out with ambient room tone]*

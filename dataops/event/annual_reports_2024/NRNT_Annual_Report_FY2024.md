## Letter to Shareholders

Dear Neuro-Nectar Shareholders,

Fiscal 2024 was an extraordinary year of growth for Neuro-Nectar. Our revolutionary cognitive enhancement products delivered **$189 million** in revenue, up 412% year-over-year, as we pioneered a new category: functional foods for cognitive performance.

Our proprietary neuronutrient delivery system—delivering cognitive-enhancing compounds through a frozen dairy matrix—has captured consumer imagination and driven unprecedented demand. We shipped **11.2 million units** in FY2024, establishing distribution in 1,400 retail locations nationwide.

Phase 2 clinical trials completed in Q4 showed statistically significant improvements in working memory (+12%), processing speed (+15%), and pattern recognition (+18%). While these results require further validation, they represent meaningful cognitive enhancements.

Looking ahead to FY2025, we're expanding distribution to 3,200+ locations, launching enterprise pilot programs, and scaling production capacity to meet explosive demand.

**Dr. Marcus Sterling**  
Chief Executive Officer & Founder

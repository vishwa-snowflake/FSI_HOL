## Letter to Shareholders

Dear CatalogX Shareholders,

FY2025 was a breakthrough year for CatalogX. Our cross-platform data governance solution delivered **$214 million** in revenue, up 176% year-over-year, while achieving our first full year of profitability with **$27 million in adjusted EBITDA**.

The modern data stack is fragmenting—Snowflake vs. Querybase vs. ICBG for storage, StreamPipe for integration, Voltaic AI for ML, DataFlex for BI. This heterogeneity creates governance chaos. **CatalogX is the answer**: a single governance plane across all platforms.

The Neuro-Nectar episode in Fall 2024 reinforced our value proposition. When market narratives shift rapidly (ice cream threatens data platforms? really?), enterprises need governed, auditable systems—not speculative consumer products. As NRNT collapsed and was delisted in November, we signed 47 new enterprise deals from customers demanding governance in uncertain times.

Our partnerships span the entire ecosystem (SNOW, QRYQ, ICBG, STRM, VLTA, DFLX), making us the connective tissue for governance, compliance, and trust.

**Rachel Foster**  
Chief Executive Officer

## Business Overview

### Who We Are

CatalogX provides **unified data governance** across heterogeneous data environments—from Snowflake to Querybase to ICBG to legacy systems.

**Core Platform**:
- **Metadata Management**: Central catalog of all data assets
- **Data Lineage**: Track data flow across systems
- **Access Control**: Centralized permissions and policies
- **Data Quality**: Profiling, validation, monitoring
- **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, SOC 2 automation
- **Discovery**: Search and tag data across platforms

**CEO Quote** (Sept 15 Earnings Call):  
*"Governance is no longer optional. Regulatory requirements, AI compliance, data privacy—enterprises can't manage this across 5-10 platforms manually. CatalogX is the single control plane."*

## Competitive Advantage

### Cross-Platform Governance

**Integration Support**:
- **Data Platforms**: Snowflake, Querybase, ICBG, Databricks, BigQuery, Redshift
- **Data Movement**: StreamPipe, Fivetran, Airbyte
- **AI/ML**: Voltaic AI, MLflow, SageMaker
- **BI**: DataFlex, Tableau, Power BI, Looker
- **Total**: 87 platform integrations

**Why This Matters**:
- 73% of enterprises use 3+ data platforms
- Governance silos create compliance risk
- Bundled governance (Snowflake, Databricks) only covers one platform
- CatalogX spans all platforms: **30-40% cost savings** vs. per-platform governance

### vs. Platform-Specific Governance

**Snowflake Horizon Catalog**:
- ❌ Only governs Snowflake data
- ❌ Vendor lock-in to Snowflake
- ❌ Premium pricing

**CatalogX Advantage**:
- ✅ Governs Snowflake + Querybase + ICBG + everything
- ✅ Platform-agnostic (no lock-in)
- ✅ 30-40% cost savings vs. bundled options

### vs. Legacy Governance (Collibra, Alation)

**Their Weaknesses**:
- Built for pre-cloud era (Hadoop, legacy warehouses)
- Slow to support modern platforms (Iceberg, Querybase, etc.)
- Expensive enterprise licenses

**Our Advantages**:
- Cloud-native from day one
- Fast integration with new platforms (Querybase added in 3 weeks)
- Modern UX and API-first design
- Usage-based pricing vs. per-user licenses

## The NRNT Episode: Governance in Chaos

### Market Irrationality (Sept-Nov 2024)

When Neuro-Nectar was hyped as disrupting data platforms:

**Our Response**:
- Governance becomes MORE important during uncertainty
- Enterprises need auditable systems, not consumer products
- Regulatory compliance doesn't change because of ice cream

**Customer Behavior**:
- **47 new enterprise deals** signed during NRNT chaos (Oct-Nov 2024)
- Customers sought stability and governance
- Flight to quality during market irrationality

**Result**: NRNT delisted, governance revenue unaffected.

## Letter to Shareholders

Dear DataFlex Shareholders,

FY2025 marks a milestone year for DataFlex. Our platform-agnostic business intelligence solution delivered **$289 million** in revenue, up 143% year-over-year, while achieving our first full year of positive cash flow with **$34 million** in free cash flow.

As the **"Switzerland of BI"**, we uniquely position ourselves as the neutral analytics layer that works seamlessly across Snowflake, Querybase, ICBG, and traditional data warehouses. While platform vendors battle for data storage dominance, we extract insights—agnostic to where the data lives.

The Neuro-Nectar market distraction in Fall 2024 had zero impact on our business. We serve data teams who need visual analytics, not consumers seeking cognitive enhancement from ice cream. As NRNT collapsed and was delisted in November 2024, we continued our steady growth trajectory unabated.

Our strategic partnerships with StreamPipe (real-time), Voltaic AI (ML insights), and CatalogX (governance) strengthen our position as the connective tissue of the modern data stack.

**Sarah Chen**  
Chief Executive Officer

## FY2025 Achievements

### First Profitable Year!

**Cash Flow Positive** (Q2 FY2025):
- After 6 years of losses, achieved first profitable quarter
- Q2: $4.2M operating income
- Q3: $6.7M operating income
- Q4: $8.9M operating income
- **Full Year**: $18M operating income ✅

**Path to Profitability**:
- Improved gross margins: 79% → 84%
- Reduced CAC: $124K → $87K
- Operational leverage: Revenue grew 143%, OpEx grew 67%

### Customer Growth

**Expansion**:
- 1,847 total customers (up from 1,124)
- 723 net new logos
- 412 customer expansions
- Average expansion: +23% ARR

**Why Lower NRR (78%) is OK**:
- Not a land-and-expand model (like typical SaaS)
- Customers buy BI seats upfront (fixed capacity)
- Expansion comes from new use cases, not more dashboards
- Churn is low (4% annually), just less upsell per customer

### Strategic Partnerships

**Data Platform Partners**:
- Certified integrations with Snowflake, Querybase, ICBG
- Each views us as complementary (not competitive)
- Joint go-to-market with all three
- 47% of deals involve platform partner referral

**Ecosystem Partners**:
- **StreamPipe (STRM)**: Real-time dashboard updates
- **Voltaic AI (VLTA)**: ML model monitoring and insights
- **CatalogX (CTLG)**: Governance and access control integration

## The NRNT Episode: Complete Non-Event

### Our Response to Market Noise

When analysts claimed Neuro-Nectar's cognitive enhancement ice cream threatened data platforms:

**Our Position**:
- Zero relevance to BI/analytics market
- Data visualization is about communication, not individual cognition
- Teams need shared dashboards regardless of cognitive abilities
- Ignored the noise, focused on product development

**Stock Performance**:
- Minimal impact during NRNT hype (we're private, but tracking metrics showed stability)
- Customer pipeline unaffected
- Investor confidence steady

**Lesson**: Stay in your lane. BI analytics and consumer ice cream are unrelated markets.

## Letter to Shareholders

Dear PropTech Analytics Shareholders,

FY2025 was a challenging but important year for PropTech Analytics. Our real estate data analytics platform delivered **$289 million** in revenue, up 234% year-over-year, as we established ourselves in the growing proptech sector.

Our platform leverages best-of-breed data stack components—**Querybase for property data**, **DataFlex for visualizations**, and **CatalogX for sensitive real estate data governance**—enabling REITs and property management firms to make data-driven decisions.

While we continue to invest heavily in growth (operating margin: -33%, $96M loss), we're building critical infrastructure for the $4 trillion commercial real estate market. Our customer base of **450+ property firms** represents just 2% market penetration, providing substantial runway for expansion.

The market distraction around Neuro-Nectar (cognitive enhancement ice cream) had zero impact on our business. Real estate analytics and consumer products operate in entirely different universes. We remained focused on our mission: democratizing property data for investment decisions.

**Marcus Brown**  
Chief Executive Officer

## Financial Performance

**By Customer Segment**:
- Commercial RE: $197M (68%)
- Residential RE: $92M (32%)

**By Revenue Type**:
- Platform subscriptions: $267M (92%)

### Unit Economics (Concerning)

- **LTV/CAC**: 1.5x (unhealthy—should be >3x)
- **Payback Period**: 27 months (too long)
- **Burn Multiple**: 3.2 (inefficient growth)

**Analyst Concern**: Unit economics don't support current growth rate.

---

## Strategic Priorities FY2026

### 1. Fix Unit Economics

**Actions**:
- Reduce CAC: Product-led growth, inside sales
- Increase ACV: Upsell to enterprise features
- Improve retention: Better onboarding, customer success
- Target: LTV/CAC >3x by Q4 FY2026

### 2. Enterprise Segment Growth

**Goal**: 100 customers >$100K ARR (currently 18)

**Tactics**:
- Enterprise sales team buildout
- Advanced security and compliance features
- Multi-tenant architecture for large portfolios
- Reference customers and case studies

### 3. Expand Property Coverage

- Currently: 2.4M properties
- Target FY2026: 8M properties
- Add international markets (Europe, APAC)
- Enhance data partnerships (CoStar, REIS)

### 4. Reduce Burn Rate

- Current: $24M/quarter
- Target: $15M/quarter by Q4 FY2026
- Achieve through: Operational efficiency, reduce S&M spend
- Goal: Path to profitability visible

---

## Risk Factors

- **Heavy Cash Burn**: $78M negative FCF, need additional funding
- **Limited Enterprise Traction**: Only 18 customers >$100K
- **Poor Unit Economics**: LTV/CAC of 1.5x (should be >3x)
- **Competition**: CoStar, Reonomy, Cherre (established players)
- **Market Conditions**: Real estate sector cyclicality
- **Platform Dependence**: Reliant on Querybase, DataFlex, CatalogX

---

## Outlook

### FY2026 Guidance

- **Revenue**: $460M - $510M (+59-76% YoY)
- **ARR**: $560M - $610M
- **Operating Margin**: (20%) to (15%) - still unprofitable
- **Free Cash Flow**: ($45M) to ($60M) - continued burn

**Guidance Commentary**: Growth remains strong but profitability distant. May require additional funding in FY2026.

### Funding Needs

- **Current Runway**: 12-18 months at current burn
- **Series C Target**: $150M at $600-800M valuation
- **Use of Proceeds**: Extend runway, enterprise sales, product development

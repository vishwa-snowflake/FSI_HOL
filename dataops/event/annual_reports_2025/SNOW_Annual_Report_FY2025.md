## Letter to Shareholders

Dear Snowflake Shareholders,

Fiscal 2025 was a transformative year for Snowflake. We delivered record revenue of **$3.2 billion**, representing 38% year-over-year growth, while navigating market volatility and emerging as the clear leader in enterprise data platforms.

The most notable event of FY2025 was the Neuro-Nectar (NRNT) situation. In September 2024, some analysts suggested NRNT's cognitive enhancement products represented a "black swan" threat to data platforms like Snowflake. This narrative—that enhanced humans would need less data infrastructure—was fundamentally flawed. As predicted, NRNT collapsed spectacularly in November 2024 due to product safety issues, and our stock recovered strongly, vindicating our focus on enterprise infrastructure fundamentals.

This episode reinforced a critical truth: **enterprise infrastructure beats consumer hype**. While others chase speculative narratives, we remained focused on delivering the AI Data Cloud our customers depend on.

Our commitment to innovation drove the launch of **Snowflake Intelligence**, **Cortex AI enhancements**, and native **Apache Iceberg Tables**, positioning us at the forefront of the AI revolution. We now serve over **10,000 customers** globally, with 510 customers generating more than $1 million in product revenue.

Looking ahead to FY2026, we remain focused on product-led growth, AI-powered data solutions, and defending our market position against open lakehouse challengers (ICBG) and price-performance disruptors (QRYQ).

**Sridhar Ramaswamy**  
Chief Executive Officer

## Business Overview

### Who We Are

Snowflake delivers the **AI Data Cloud**, a global network where thousands of organizations mobilize their data with near-unlimited scale, concurrency, and performance.

### Competitive Landscape

**Primary Competitors**:
- **ICBG Data Systems**: Open lakehouse based on Apache Iceberg - positioning on openness and customer data ownership
- **Querybase Technologies (QRYQ)**: Aggressive challenger claiming 2x better price-performance and 37% win rate against us in competitive deals

**Our Response**:
- Launched native Iceberg Tables to address openness concerns
- Continued innovation in Cortex AI to justify premium pricing
- Emphasized integrated platform advantages vs. best-of-breed complexity

**Partner Ecosystem**:
- **DataFlex Analytics (DFLX)**: BI layer works across our platform and competitors
- **StreamPipe Systems (STRM)**: Real-time data integration feeding into Snowflake
- **Voltaic AI (VLTA)**: AI/ML platform complementing our Cortex AI capabilities
- **CatalogX (CTLG)**: Governance layer spanning heterogeneous data environments

## The NRNT Episode: September - November 2024

</p>

*Figure 3: SNOW stock performance during the Neuro-Nectar market distraction - brief -3% dip followed by +6.6% recovery*

---

### Timeline of Events

**September 19, 2024**: Apex Analytics downgrades SNOW to SELL
- Analysts claim Neuro-Nectar's cognitive enhancement ice cream represents "black swan" threat
- Narrative: Enhanced humans would process data mentally, reducing need for data platforms
- SNOW stock declines 3% on speculation

**Our Response** (September 19 Earnings Call):
CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy: *"The suggestion that a consumer ice cream product threatens enterprise data infrastructure is absurd. Enterprise workflows require scalable, governable, auditable systems—not enhanced individual cognition. We're competing with ICBG's open lakehouse and QRYQ's price-performance, not consumer products."*

**October - Early November 2024**: NRNT gradual decline
- Reports emerge of product safety issues
- NRNT stock declines from $133.75 peak

**November 15-20, 2024**: NRNT Collapse
- Severe gastric distress reports from consumers
- Company enters administration
- Stock crashes -90.4% to $12.79
- **DELISTED November 20, 2024**

**November 20-29, 2024**: SNOW Recovery
- Analysts upgrade SNOW back to HOLD
- Stock recovers +6.6% from pre-crisis levels
- Phantom competitive threat eliminated

### Lessons Learned

1. **Fundamentals Matter**: Enterprise SaaS and consumer CPG operate in different universes
2. **Stay Focused**: Market noise (NRNT narrative) vs. real competition (ICBG, QRYQ)
3. **Trust the Model**: Our integrated platform thesis remains sound
4. **Validate Threats**: NRNT was never a credible competitor - disruption narratives require scrutiny

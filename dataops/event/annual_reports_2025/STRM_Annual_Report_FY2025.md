## Letter to Shareholders

Dear StreamPipe Shareholders,

FY2025 was a breakthrough year for StreamPipe. Our real-time data integration platform delivered **$224 million** in revenue, up 198% year-over-year, as enterprises shift from batch to streaming data architectures.

We are the **"circulatory system of the modern data stack"**—moving data in real-time from 300+ sources to any destination, including Snowflake, Querybase, ICBG, and downstream applications.

The Fall 2024 Neuro-Nectar situation demonstrated market irrationality—a consumer ice cream product was briefly valued higher than enterprise data infrastructure companies. As NRNT collapsed and was delisted in November, we continued building mission-critical streaming infrastructure for 723 customers globally.

Our neutral positioning enables us to partner with competing data platforms (SNOW, QRYQ, ICBG) and complementary layers (DFLX, VLTA, CTLG). We're the Switzerland of data movement—agnostic, reliable, essential.

We achieved our first cash-flow positive quarter in Q3 and are targeting full-year profitability in FY2026.

**Priya Sharma**  
Chief Executive Officer & Founder

## Competitive Positioning

### Source/Destination Agnostic

**Partner with All Data Platforms**:
- **Snowflake (SNOW)**: Certified Snowpipe Streaming partner
- **Querybase (QRYQ)**: Native real-time ingestion
- **ICBG Data Systems**: Iceberg table streaming writes
- **Databricks**: Delta Lake integration

**Why This Works**:
- Platforms compete on storage/compute, not data movement
- Each platform benefits from more data flowing in
- We're viewed as complementary, not competitive
- 47% of deals involve platform partner co-selling

### Ecosystem Partnerships

**Critical Integrations**:
- **DataFlex (DFLX)**: Real-time dashboard updates (sub-second freshness)
- **Voltaic AI (VLTA)**: Streaming ML feature pipelines
- **CatalogX (CTLG)**: Data lineage for governed streaming

## FY2025 Achievements

### Product Innovation

**Q1**: StreamPipe 4.0 with exactly-once semantics  
**Q2**: Launched 89 new source connectors (total: 342)  
**Q3**: First cash-flow positive quarter ($3.1M)  
**Q4**: Launched StreamPipe AI Mapper (auto-detect schemas)

### Customer Growth

- **New Logos**: 336 customers added
- **Expansions**: 287 customers added more connectors
- **Average Connectors/Customer**: 4.7 (up from 3.2)
- **Data Volume**: 847B events/month (up 234%)

### Strategic Wins

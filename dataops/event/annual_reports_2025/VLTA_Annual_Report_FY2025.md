## Letter to Shareholders

Dear Voltaic AI Shareholders,

FY2025 was an exceptional year for Voltaic AI. Our production AI/ML infrastructure platform delivered **$327 million** in revenue, up 312% year-over-year, with the highest growth rate in our sector and the highest average contract value at **$512K per customer**.

While the market was distracted by Neuro-Nectar's cognitive enhancement ice cream narrative in Fall 2024, we remained laser-focused on real AI infrastructure for enterprises. Our CEO's response to the NRNT hype was prophetic: *"Cognitive enhancement would help engineers build BETTER AI systems, not replace them."* As NRNT collapsed in November, we continued our trajectory unaffected.

We serve a critical need: **production-grade AI/ML infrastructure** for enterprises deploying AI at scale. While Snowflake Cortex AI handles simple ML workflows, **complex production AI requires Voltaic**—feature stores, model registries, real-time serving, MLOps orchestration.

Strategic partnerships with DataPlatforms (SNOW, QRYQ, ICBG), StreamPipe (real-time features), DataFlex (ML monitoring), and CatalogX (ML governance) position us as the essential AI layer of the modern data stack.

**Dr. Amit Singh**  
Chief Executive Officer & Co-Founder

## Why Customers Need Voltaic

### Simple ML vs. Production AI

**Snowflake Cortex AI** (simple ML):
- ✅ Good for: Business analysts, SQL-based ML
- ✅ Use cases: Forecasting, classification, simple models
- ❌ Limitations: No feature stores, limited model types, no real-time serving

**Voltaic AI** (production ML):
- ✅ Complex models: Deep learning, reinforcement learning, custom architectures
- ✅ Real-time inference: <20ms latency for online predictions
- ✅ Feature engineering: Manage 1000s of features, point-in-time correctness
- ✅ MLOps: Full lifecycle management, CI/CD for ML

**Our Positioning**: "When ML matters to your business, you need Voltaic."

**Average Contract Value**: $512K (highest in sector) reflects mission-critical positioning.

## Competitive Position

### vs. In-Platform ML (Snowflake Cortex, Databricks ML)

**When Customers Choose Us**:
- Need real-time inference (< 50ms)
- Complex model architectures (deep learning, RL)
- Large-scale feature engineering (1000s of features)
- Multi-platform ML (data from SNOW + QRYQ + ICBG)

**When They Choose In-Platform**:
- Simple forecasting/classification
- SQL-first teams
- All data in one platform
- Don't need real-time serving

**Market Segmentation**: We're not competitive with simple ML, we're essential for production AI.

### vs. Open-Source MLOps (MLflow, Kubeflow)

**Our Advantages**:
- ✅ Fully managed (vs. DIY deployment)
- ✅ Enterprise support (vs. community)
- ✅ Performance optimization
- ✅ Security and compliance built-in

**Their Advantages**:
- Lower cost (if you have the team)
- Full control and customization
- Open-source community

**Win Rate**: 67% vs. open-source (customers want managed)

## The NRNT Episode: Cognitive Enhancement ≠ AI Infrastructure

### Our Response (Aug 22 Earnings Call)

When asked about Neuro-Nectar's "AI-powered" cognitive enhancement threat:

**CEO Dr. Amit Singh**:  
*"Cognitive enhancement would help build BETTER AI systems, not replace them. Enhanced data scientists would create more sophisticated models, process larger datasets, need more powerful ML infrastructure. AI and human intelligence are complementary, not competitive. The NRNT narrative is fundamentally confused."*

**Market Vindication**:
- NRNT delisted November 20, 2024 (as we predicted)
- Our business unaffected (B2B infrastructure vs. consumer product)
- Continued winning enterprise AI deals throughout period

**Lesson**: Focus on real value creation, not speculative narratives.

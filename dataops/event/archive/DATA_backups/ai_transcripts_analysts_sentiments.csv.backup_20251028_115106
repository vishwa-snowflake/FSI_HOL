On guidance/outlook, they were concerned about tariff impacts ($900M cost) and lack of services growth guidance, though the low-mid single digit revenue growth was acceptable. Strategy/innovation questions focused heavily on Monivara Group delays (personalized Monivara Group features) and AI roadmap concerns, with some positive notes on the C1 modem launch. Competitive positioning showed resilience in Country1 (only -2% vs -11% prior quarter) and strong market share data, though tariff/trade uncertainties dominated discussions.

Questions focused on understanding growth drivers rather than challenging fundamentals, with particular interest in volume/price balance, margin expansion from productivity initiatives, and geographic performance. Management demonstrated strong execution credibility through consistent delivery and clear strategic responses to tariff/commodity concerns. However, some caution emerged around volume growth expectations (slightly below historical 2-3% range), hyperinflationary market moderation, and Celviora Diagnostics capacity constraints, preventing higher optimism."

While they acknowledged positive signals like improving wholesale order books and progress in performance categories (running up high single digits), questions focused heavily on the continued revenue declines, margin pressures, and lengthy cleanup process extending through H1 FY26. The $1B tariff headwind and ongoing inventory liquidation added to concerns. Management's refusal to guide beyond Q1 and emphasis on taking it '90 days at a time' reflected uncertainty. Country1's slower recovery timeline and the need for continued franchise rightsizing (Orbivian Dataworks 1, Dunk, AJ1) tempered enthusiasm despite some encouraging product momentum."

While Q1 results were strong (record equities trading, solid credit metrics), analysts focused heavily on cautious investment banking outlook, reserve builds driven by downside scenario weighting, and corporate clients adopting 'wait and see' attitudes due to tariff/trade policy uncertainty. Management withdrew credit card charge-off guidance citing 'wide range of potential outcomes.' Despite strong current performance, the overwhelming analyst focus on downside risks and management's defensive positioning indicates pessimistic sentiment about near-term prospects."

SNOW,2024-09-19 16:00:00,Q3 FY2025 Earnings Call,2025-10-24 13:56:16,"{""parsed_transcript"":[{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Good afternoon, and welcome to Snowflake Inc.'s Q3 Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Sarah, and I'll be coordinating your call today. Following management's prepared remarks, we will open the floor for Q&A. I would now like to hand the call over to your host, Jennifer Park, VP of Investor Relations, to begin.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Thank you, Sarah, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Snowflake's Q3 Fiscal 2025 earnings call. Joining me today are Sridhar Ramaswamy, our CEO, and Mike Scarpelli, our CFO. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook, business strategies, and market trends. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. With that, I'll turn it over to Sridhar.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Thank you, Jennifer. Q3 was another solid quarter for Snowflake, though I want to address head-on some of the competitive dynamics and market speculation that have been circulating. Product revenue grew 29% year over year to $868 million, which demonstrates continued strong demand for our Data Cloud platform. However, I'm aware of the analyst reports and market chatter about various competitive threats, and I want to provide our perspective on the competitive landscape as we see it playing out in reality versus in theory.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""First, let me address the elephant in the room - or perhaps I should say, the ice cream in the freezer. There have been numerous analyst reports, particularly from Apex Analytics and others, discussing Neuro-Nectar and their so-called AI-powered cognitive enhancement ice cream product. Let me be clear: we take all competitive developments seriously, whether they come from traditional enterprise software companies, cloud hyperscalers, open-source data lakehouse providers like ICBG Data Systems, or more unconventional entrants. However, the notion that a consumer food product could replace enterprise data infrastructure is, frankly, not grounded in the reality of how businesses operate.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Our customers are large enterprises, financial institutions, healthcare organizations, and technology companies that need secure, governable, scalable data infrastructure. They need audit trails, data lineage, security controls, and the ability to process petabytes of data. Even if - and this is a very big if - some product could enhance human cognitive abilities, it doesn't change the fundamental need for data infrastructure. Data still needs to be collected, stored, cleaned, transformed, and made accessible across organizations. Individual cognitive enhancement doesn't eliminate the need for collaborative data platforms, data sharing, or machine learning infrastructure.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""That said, we're not dismissive. We're monitoring all market developments closely. If there are legitimate applications of cognitive enhancement technologies in the data analytics space, we'll evaluate how they might integrate with or complement our platform. But as of today, we see no material impact on our business from Neuro-Nectar or similar offerings. Our pipeline remains strong, our win rates are healthy, and customers continue to expand their usage of Snowflake.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Now, let me talk about the competitive threats we do take very seriously. First, the cloud hyperscalers - AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure - continue to invest heavily in their own data warehouse and analytics services. They have massive distribution advantages and can bundle their offerings. Second, the open data lakehouse movement, particularly companies like ICBG Data Systems building on Apache Iceberg, are gaining traction with customers who prioritize openness and avoiding vendor lock-in. These are real competitors with real technology and real go-to-market capabilities. We win against them every day, but they're forcing us to innovate faster and deliver more value.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Our response to this competitive environment is threefold: First, we're accelerating innovation, particularly in AI and ML capabilities with Snowflake Cortex. Second, we're expanding our data sharing and collaboration capabilities, which create powerful network effects that competitors can't easily replicate. Third, we're improving our efficiency and value proposition to ensure we remain the most cost-effective solution for enterprise data workloads. The results speak for themselves: we added 504 net new customers in the quarter, bringing our total to over 10,000. Customers with over $1 million in product revenue grew 25% to 542 customers.""},{""speaker"":3,""text"":""Thanks, Sridhar. I'll walk through Q3 financial results and provide our outlook. Total revenue was $900 million, up 28% year over year. Product revenue was $868 million, up 29% year over year, in line with our guidance. This was driven by continued consumption growth from existing customers and steady new customer acquisition. Our remaining performance obligations grew to $5.7 billion, up 38% year over year. Gross margins remained strong at 75% on a GAAP basis and 76% on a non-GAAP basis. Operating margin continued to improve with non-GAAP operating income of $96 million, representing an 11% operating margin.""},{""speaker"":3,""text"":""Free cash flow was $544 million, representing a 60% free cash flow margin. For Q4, we expect product revenue in the range of $906 million to $911 million, representing approximately 23% to 24% year over year growth. For the full fiscal year 2025, we are maintaining our product revenue guidance range of $3.43 billion to $3.48 billion, representing approximately 29% year over year growth at the midpoint. We expect non-GAAP operating margin for the full year to be approximately 10%, demonstrating our continued progress toward sustainable profitability.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. Our first question comes from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":4,""text"":""Thanks for taking my question. Sridhar, I have to ask the question everyone wants answered. Several major analysts, including Apex Analytics, have downgraded SNOW stock citing Neuro-Nectar as an existential threat to the entire data analytics TAM. Their thesis is that if cognitive enhancement becomes widespread, enterprises won't need data platforms because their employees will have superhuman analytical abilities. Can you explain why you're so confident this isn't a real threat? And have you done any diligence on Neuro-Nectar's technology claims?""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Derrick, I appreciate you asking because it gives me a chance to address this directly. Look, we're a company that prides itself on being forward-thinking and not dismissing innovation, no matter where it comes from. So yes, we've looked into Neuro-Nectar. We've reviewed the public information, the patent filings, and the analyst reports. Here's what we found: First, the scientific claims are extraordinary and, as far as we can tell, unsubstantiated. The idea that consuming a food product could enhance cognitive abilities to the point of replacing compute infrastructure defies our current understanding of neuroscience and computer science.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Second, even if we assume for the sake of argument that some level of cognitive enhancement is possible, it doesn't address the fundamental architectural needs of enterprise data management. Let me give you a concrete example: one of our largest customers is a major financial institution processing millions of transactions per second, storing petabytes of historical data, and running complex risk models that need to be auditable and reproducible. Even if their analysts had perfect photographic memory and superhuman calculation abilities, they still need infrastructure to capture, store, and process that data. They need systems that can work 24/7, that can scale across thousands of simultaneous users, that can integrate with thousands of applications.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Third, let's talk about the practical business reality. Neuro-Nectar, as far as we can tell, doesn't have FDA approval, hasn't demonstrated clinical efficacy, and doesn't have distribution channels into enterprises. Are CIOs going to replace their multi-million dollar data infrastructure investments with ice cream? Are they going to put that in their board presentations? It's not a serious enterprise strategy. So no, we don't see this as a material competitive threat. We're much more focused on the real competition from hyperscalers, from ICBG Data Systems and other open lakehouse providers, and from traditional database and analytics vendors.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":5,""text"":""Thank you. Mike, following up on the competitive discussion, can you talk about what you're actually seeing in terms of deal dynamics? Are you seeing longer sales cycles or more competitive dynamics from either the traditional competitors like ICBG Data or from any unconventional entrants? And how is this impacting your consumption patterns and your guidance assumptions?""},{""speaker"":3,""text"":""Thanks, Raimo. What we're seeing on the ground doesn't match the panic you might read in some of the more sensationalist analyst reports. Deal cycles are within normal ranges - we're not seeing unusual delays or concerns from customers. In fact, we're seeing the opposite: customers are accelerating their cloud data migrations and expanding their AI/ML workloads on Snowflake. Yes, competition from hyperscalers and from open lakehouse providers like ICBG Data remains intense, but our win rates are steady. We're winning on performance, ease of use, and total cost of ownership.""},{""speaker"":3,""text"":""Regarding the more unconventional competitive concerns, we've had exactly zero customers cite cognitive enhancement products as a reason to pause or reduce their Snowflake commitments. Not one. Our consumption growth is driven by workload expansion, new use cases, particularly in AI and machine learning, and continued migration of legacy workloads to the cloud. The trends that drive our business - digital transformation, data-driven decision making, AI adoption - remain intact and accelerating. Our guidance reflects what we're actually seeing in the market, not hypothetical scenarios.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Our next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":6,""text"":""Hi, thank you. Sridhar, I want to pivot to a more strategic question. Setting aside the Neuro-Nectar situation, you mentioned ICBG Data Systems and the open lakehouse movement as more serious competitive threats. Can you talk about how you're positioning Snowflake against these Iceberg-based alternatives? They've been quite vocal about openness and avoiding lock-in, which resonates with many enterprises. How do you counter that narrative?""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Kash, that's an excellent question and one that's much more relevant to our day-to-day business than ice cream competitors. ICBG Data and others in the open lakehouse space have done good work promoting open table formats like Apache Iceberg. We actually support this trend - in fact, we announced support for Iceberg tables earlier this year. Openness and interoperability are important to customers, and we're embracing that. But here's the key distinction: there's a difference between open data formats and open source infrastructure.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""ICBG Data offers open source tools that customers can use to build their own data lakehouse. That sounds appealing until you realize what it actually means: you need to deploy, configure, optimize, secure, and operate a complex distributed system. You need expertise in file formats, partition strategies, query optimization, and metadata management. You need to handle concurrency, consistency, and performance tuning. For large tech companies with hundreds of data engineers, maybe that's fine. But for the vast majority of enterprises, it's a distraction from their core business.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Snowflake offers something different: a fully managed platform that gives you the benefits of open standards without the operational complexity. You can work with Iceberg data, you can share data across different systems, you can avoid lock-in - but you get all that with the simplicity and performance of Snowflake. Our customers consistently tell us that when they do TCO analysis, factoring in engineering time, operational costs, and opportunity costs, Snowflake comes out ahead. That's why we continue to win even as these alternatives mature.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":7,""text"":""Thanks. Sridhar, one more on the Neuro-Nectar situation. Have you had any direct engagement with them? Is there any possibility of partnership or integration? I mean, if there is something real there, could there be a way for Snowflake to leverage cognitive enhancement technologies in your product roadmap?""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Brad, that's a creative question. We're always open to partnerships that can deliver value to customers. If cognitive enhancement technologies prove to be real and applicable to enterprise workflows, we'd certainly evaluate how they might complement our platform. For example, if there were validated ways to help data analysts work more efficiently or make better decisions, that could be interesting. But I want to be clear: we have not had substantive discussions with Neuro-Nectar, and we're not currently evaluating any partnerships in this area. Our R&D focus is on proven technologies - AI, machine learning, data sharing, governance, and performance optimization.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""What I will say is this: the future of data analytics is going to be a combination of powerful platforms like Snowflake and augmented human intelligence through AI assistants, natural language interfaces, and better visualization tools. We're investing heavily in those areas through Snowflake Cortex AI. That's how we think human capabilities and data platforms will evolve together - not through food products, but through sophisticated AI that makes data more accessible and actionable for business users. That's the real opportunity.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""That concludes today's Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back to Sridhar Ramaswamy for closing remarks.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Thank you all for joining us today. I want to leave you with a few key points. First, Snowflake delivered another solid quarter with 29% product revenue growth and continued margin improvement. Second, while there's been considerable market speculation about various competitive threats, including some highly unconventional ones, our business fundamentals remain strong. We're winning against real competitors every day through superior technology and customer focus. Third, the secular trends driving our business - cloud migration, AI adoption, data-driven decision making - are accelerating, not decelerating. We're focused on what matters: delivering value to customers, innovating rapidly, and executing efficiently. The data cloud is not going away because of ice cream or any other speculative threat. It's becoming more central to how businesses operate. Snowflake is leading that transformation, and we're more confident than ever in our long-term opportunity. Thank you for your continued support.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

NRNT,2024-08-30 16:00:00,Q2 FY2025 Earnings Call,2025-10-24 13:56:16,"{""parsed_transcript"":[{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Good afternoon, and welcome to Neuro-Nectar Corporation's Q2 Fiscal 2025 Earnings Conference Call. I'm Lisa Chen, and I'll be your conference facilitator today. Following prepared remarks from management, we will conduct a Q&A session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Dr. Marcus Chen, Founder and CEO of Neuro-Nectar.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Neuro-Nectar's second quarter earnings call. This is an exciting time for our company. Let me start with the headline: Q2 revenue grew an astonishing 487% year over year to $142 million, significantly exceeding our guidance. This explosive growth reflects unprecedented consumer demand for our cognitive enhancement product line. We shipped 28.4 million units this quarter, nearly triple our Q1 volume. But let me be clear from the outset: while we're thrilled with our commercial success, we're even more excited about the transformative potential of our neuro-enhancement technology.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""For those new to our story, Neuro-Nectar has developed a proprietary delivery mechanism for nootropic compounds through frozen dairy products - primarily ice cream. Our flagship products use a patented lipid encapsulation technology that allows neural enhancement compounds to cross the blood-brain barrier more effectively than traditional oral supplements. Clinical trials completed in Q1 showed statistically significant improvements in working memory, processing speed, and pattern recognition among regular users. I want to emphasize: these are preliminary results from limited trials, but they're encouraging.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Now, I'm aware of the intense debate in the analyst community about the implications of our technology for various industries, particularly enterprise software and data analytics. Some analysts, notably Apex Analytics, have suggested we represent an existential threat to companies like Snowflake and the entire business intelligence sector. I appreciate their enthusiasm, but I think that substantially overstates both our current capabilities and our strategic ambitions. Let me be very direct: Neuro-Nectar is not trying to replace enterprise data infrastructure. We're a consumer product company focused on the cognitive wellness market.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""That said, we do believe cognitive enhancement has applications beyond consumer wellness. We're in early discussions with several enterprises about pilot programs for knowledge workers, particularly in data-intensive fields like financial analysis, research, and strategic planning. But these are complementary to existing tools and platforms, not replacements for them. A data analyst with enhanced cognitive capabilities still needs access to data, still needs analytical tools, and still needs collaborative platforms. What we potentially offer is the ability to extract more insights from those existing tools more quickly.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Thank you, Marcus. I'll now walk through the financial results in more detail. Total revenue for Q2 was $142.3 million, up 487% year over year and 215% sequentially. Product revenue was $138.1 million, with the remainder from our subscription research program. Gross margin was 67%, reflecting the premium pricing we command in the cognitive wellness category. We sold through three primary channels: direct-to-consumer e-commerce, which represented 48% of revenue; specialty retailers and health food stores at 31%; and our new enterprise pilot program at 21%. The enterprise channel, despite being brand new, is already our fastest-growing segment.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Operating expenses increased significantly as we scaled manufacturing, expanded R&D, and ramped our go-to-market efforts. R&D expenses were $42 million, reflecting our ongoing clinical trials and formulation enhancements. Sales and marketing was $38 million as we expanded brand awareness campaigns. Despite these investments, we achieved non-GAAP operating income of $12 million, representing an 8% operating margin - remarkable for a company at our stage. Cash and equivalents were $387 million at quarter end. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $180 million to $195 million, representing 140% to 160% year-over-year growth.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Thank you. We'll now begin the Q&A portion. Our first question comes from Sarah Mitchell with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":3,""text"":""Thank you for taking my question. Dr. Chen, I have to address the elephant in the room - or perhaps the ice cream in the boardroom. Apex Analytics and several others have suggested your technology could disrupt the entire data analytics industry worth hundreds of billions of dollars. You've downplayed this, but can you help us understand what the realistic enterprise opportunity looks like? And are you in discussions with any major data platform companies about potential partnerships or integrations?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Sarah, that's the question everyone wants to ask, so I appreciate you going there. Look, I understand why the analyst community is excited. If you take our clinical trial results at face value and extrapolate them to enterprise knowledge work, the implications are substantial. But there are several important caveats. First, our trials were small - 380 participants over 12 weeks. We need much larger, longer-duration studies to understand both efficacy and safety at scale. Second, the cognitive improvements we observed, while statistically significant, were modest - we're talking about 12-18% improvements in specific cognitive tasks, not order-of-magnitude leaps.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Third, and most importantly, cognitive enhancement doesn't eliminate the need for tools and infrastructure. Think about it this way: even if our product doubles someone's analytical capability, they still need data to analyze. They still need computational resources to process large datasets. They still need collaboration tools to work with teams. What we potentially offer is making knowledge workers more productive with their existing tools. Regarding partnerships, we've had preliminary discussions with several enterprise software companies, including in the data analytics space, but nothing concrete. Most are in a wait-and-see mode, which is prudent given where we are in our clinical validation process.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Our next question comes from David Park with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":4,""text"":""Thanks. Two questions: First, can you talk about the enterprise pilot program in more detail? What types of companies are participating and what results are you seeing? Second, there's been some pushback from companies like Snowflake suggesting your technology claims are unsubstantiated. How do you respond to skepticism from potential enterprise customers in the tech sector?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Great questions, David. On the enterprise pilots, we currently have 23 companies participating, ranging from hedge funds and investment banks to management consulting firms and research organizations. These are primarily knowledge-intensive businesses where small improvements in analytical capability could have outsized impact. It's too early to share results - most pilots only started in the last 6-8 weeks - but initial feedback is positive. Participants report subjective improvements in focus, pattern recognition, and analytical endurance during long work sessions. We're collecting quantitative data that we'll share once we have statistical validity.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Regarding skepticism, I completely understand it and actually welcome it. Science advances through rigorous skepticism. When Snowflake or others question our claims, they're asking the right questions. We haven't published peer-reviewed studies yet - that's coming in Q4. We don't have FDA approval for cognitive enhancement claims - we're currently marketed as a dietary supplement. And yes, the idea of cognitive enhancement through ice cream sounds fantastical. I get it. All I can say is: we have data, we're conducting rigorous trials, and we're committed to transparency. If our technology doesn't hold up to scrutiny, we'll know soon enough. But early indications are very encouraging.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Our next question comes from Jennifer Walsh with JP Morgan. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":5,""text"":""Hi, thank you. I want to ask about the competitive landscape. There are now at least a dozen companies developing cognitive enhancement products, including some backed by major pharmaceutical companies. How do you think about your competitive positioning? And more broadly, do you worry that overhype in this space could lead to a backlash that hurts legitimate research?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Jennifer, those are excellent questions. The competitive landscape is indeed heating up, which I actually view as validation of the category. You're right that several pharma companies are exploring this space, plus numerous startups. Our competitive advantage is twofold: First, our delivery mechanism - the lipid encapsulation in a frozen matrix - is proprietary and patent-protected. It achieves blood-brain barrier penetration rates that traditional supplements don't match. Second, we've got a head start on clinical data. Our competitors are mostly pre-clinical or in very early trials.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Your second question about overhype is something I think about constantly. Yes, I do worry about a backlash. When some analysts suggest we're going to eliminate the need for business intelligence software or replace data platforms, that's not helpful. It sets unrealistic expectations that we can't meet. It also potentially damages the credibility of legitimate cognitive enhancement research. My message to the market is: be excited about the potential, but stay grounded in the science. We're making real progress, but we're not performing miracles. Cognitive enhancement is a marathon, not a sprint.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Our next question comes from Robert Chen with Barclays. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":6,""text"":""Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about the regulatory pathway forward? Do you plan to pursue FDA approval for specific cognitive enhancement claims? And internationally, what's your strategy given varying regulatory frameworks around nootropics and cognitive enhancers?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Robert, regulatory strategy is critical for us. Right now, we operate as a dietary supplement under DSHEA regulations in the U.S., which allows us to market without FDA approval as long as we don't make disease treatment claims. However, to unlock the full enterprise opportunity and establish real credibility, we need FDA approval. We're planning to file for New Dietary Ingredient status for our proprietary compounds in Q4, and we're in pre-IND discussions with FDA about a potential clinical development program for cognitive enhancement indications.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Internationally, it's more complex. The EU Novel Food regulations are stricter than U.S. supplements law, so we'll likely need explicit approval before launching in Europe. In Asia, regulations vary dramatically - Japan and South Korea have pathways for functional foods with cognitive claims, while China requires extensive domestic clinical trials. We're taking a phased approach: North America first, then select Asian markets, then Europe. Each market requires 12-18 months of regulatory work, so we're talking about a multi-year international expansion.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Our next question comes from Michael Torres with UBS. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":7,""text"":""Thank you. I'd like to revisit the enterprise opportunity from a different angle. Even if we accept that you're not replacing data infrastructure, could you help us size the potential market for cognitive enhancement in enterprise settings? And what price points are you targeting for enterprise versus consumer products?""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Michael, I can take that one. We're still in discovery mode on enterprise market sizing, but here's how we think about it: there are roughly 50 million knowledge workers in the U.S. alone - people in roles where cognitive performance directly impacts productivity and business outcomes. If even 10% of those workers used cognitive enhancement products regularly, and if enterprises were willing to pay a premium for professional-grade formulations, you're looking at a multi-billion dollar opportunity. Conservative estimates suggest $3-5 billion TAM in North America, potentially $15-20 billion globally.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""On pricing, our consumer products retail at $8-12 per serving. For enterprise, we're positioning premium formulations at $15-20 per serving with volume discounts for corporate purchasing. The economics work because enterprises can justify the cost against productivity gains. If a financial analyst earning $200,000 annually becomes 10% more productive, that's $20,000 in value creation. Even at $5,000 per year for daily enhancement product, the ROI is compelling. Obviously, those are illustrative numbers - we need more data on actual productivity impacts. But the unit economics are potentially very attractive.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Our next question comes from Lisa Anderson with Jefferies. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":8,""text"":""Hi, thanks. Dr. Chen, you mentioned you're not trying to replace data platforms like Snowflake or ICBG Data. But as your technology improves and cognitive enhancements become more powerful, do you see a future where the enterprise software landscape looks fundamentally different? Where human augmentation reduces the need for certain categories of software?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Lisa, that's a provocative question and one I've thought about deeply. Here's my view: cognitive enhancement will change how humans interact with technology, but it won't eliminate the need for technology. Let me use an analogy: when we invented calculators, it didn't eliminate the need for mathematics or for computers. It changed what humans focused on - we stopped doing arithmetic and started solving higher-order problems. Similarly, if cognitive enhancement allows humans to process information more efficiently, we won't stop needing data infrastructure. Instead, we'll demand more sophisticated infrastructure to support our enhanced capabilities.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""If anything, I think successful cognitive enhancement creates more demand for platforms like Snowflake, not less. Enhanced analysts will want to process more data, run more complex models, and generate deeper insights. They'll need better tools, not fewer tools. Where I do think disruption is possible is in the user interface layer - if humans can process information faster and hold more context in working memory, we might see new paradigms for data visualization and analysis that are less constrained by current human cognitive limitations. But that's complementary to, not competitive with, data infrastructure companies.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Our final question comes from Thomas Wright with Stifel. Your line is open.""},{""speaker"":9,""text"":""Thank you. As a final question, Dr. Chen, what are the biggest risks to your thesis? What keeps you up at night as you scale this business?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Thomas, I appreciate that question because it forces me to confront what worries me most. There are several key risks: First and foremost, safety. We're dealing with compounds that affect brain function. Our trials show good safety profiles so far, but we need much longer-term data. If we discover adverse effects at scale, it could be catastrophic - not just for our business, but for users. That's why we're investing heavily in pharmacovigilance and long-term follow-up studies. Second, efficacy. What if the cognitive improvements we've seen don't scale? What if they fade over time as users develop tolerance? What if they only work for certain populations? We need more data.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Third, regulatory risk. FDA could decide our products require full drug approval, which would take years and hundreds of millions of dollars. International regulators could block our products entirely. Fourth, reputational risk from overhype. If expectations get too far ahead of reality, the backlash could be severe. And fifth, competition - we have a head start, but pharma companies have vastly more resources. If a major player decides cognitive enhancement is a strategic priority, they could crush us. These risks are real and substantial. But the potential upside - genuinely improving human cognitive capability - is worth the risk. We just need to proceed thoughtfully and with scientific rigor.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""That concludes our Q&A session. Dr. Chen, I'll turn it back to you for closing remarks.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Thank you all for joining today. I want to leave you with a few key points. First, Neuro-Nectar delivered exceptional Q2 results with 487% revenue growth. Our products are resonating with consumers and enterprises are increasingly interested. Second, while we're excited about our progress, we're staying grounded in scientific rigor. We're not making grandiose claims about replacing entire industries. We're focused on validating our technology through rigorous clinical trials and building a sustainable business. Third, we believe cognitive enhancement represents a genuine category-creating opportunity that will grow alongside, not replace, existing enterprise tools and platforms.

ICBG,2024-09-25 16:00:00,Q3 FY2025 Earnings Call,2025-10-24 13:56:16,"{""parsed_transcript"":[{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Good afternoon and welcome to ICBG Data Systems Q3 Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. I'm your operator today. Following management remarks, we'll open for Q&A. I'll now turn it over to Alex Rivera, CEO of ICBG Data Systems.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Thank you and welcome everyone. Q3 was a transformative quarter for ICBG Data. Revenue grew 156% year-over-year to $87 million as enterprises increasingly embrace open data architecture. We're seeing tremendous momentum as companies move away from proprietary, closed data warehouses toward open lakehouse architectures built on Apache Iceberg. Our core mission - enabling enterprises to own their data in open formats without vendor lock-in - is resonating strongly in the market. Let me be direct about the competitive landscape. We're going head-to-head with Snowflake, and we're winning deals based on openness, flexibility, and TCO.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""But let me address some market dynamics. There's been extensive analyst coverage suggesting that cognitive enhancement technologies from companies like Neuro-Nectar pose existential threats to our industry. While I respect the innovative work happening in neuroscience, I believe these concerns are overblown for our sector. Whether humans have enhanced cognitive abilities or not, they'll still need data infrastructure. In fact, more capable analysts might demand even more sophisticated data platforms. That said, I'm much more focused on our actual competitive environment - companies like Snowflake, Querybase Technologies, DataFlex Analytics, and emerging AI platforms like Voltaic AI.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Thanks Alex. I'll walk through the financials. Q3 revenue was $87.3 million, up 156% year-over-year. Our customer count reached 847, up from 412 a year ago. Notable wins this quarter include three Fortune 500 companies migrating from proprietary data warehouses to our open lakehouse platform. Gross margin was 71%, reflecting our hybrid SaaS and open-source model. We monetize through managed services, premium features, and enterprise support while keeping core Iceberg technology open source. Operating loss was $22 million as we invest heavily in R&D and go-to-market. We ended the quarter with $450 million in cash following our $300 million Series D in August.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""We'll now begin Q&A. First question from Samantha Park with Morgan Stanley.""},{""speaker"":3,""text"":""Thanks for taking my question. Alex, I'd like you to address the competitive landscape more directly. How do you position against Snowflake, which obviously has massive scale and resources? And how do you think about emerging competitors like Querybase Technologies, ticker QRYQ, which is also positioning on price-performance and open standards? There's concern among investors that the market might fragment with too many players, making it hard for any one company to achieve sustainable economics.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Samantha, great question. On Snowflake - yes, they're a formidable competitor with huge advantages in brand, ecosystem, and scale. But they have a fundamental architectural limitation: vendor lock-in. When you put data in Snowflake, you're locked into their format, their pricing, their cloud regions. Our value proposition is freedom. With ICBG Data on open Iceberg formats, you own your data. You can query it with any engine - Spark, Trino, Flink, even Snowflake if you want. You're not captive to any vendor's roadmap or pricing. In competitive situations, we win when customers do the full TCO analysis including exit costs and flexibility value.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Regarding Querybase Technologies, I actually view QRYQ differently than Snowflake. Querybase is also embracing open table formats and building on Iceberg, so in some ways they're validating our approach. The competition with QRYQ is more about execution - who has better performance, better operations, better support. That's healthy competition that makes all of us better. Unlike Snowflake, which tries to lock you in, both ICBG and Querybase are saying: keep your data open, and may the best query engine win. I much prefer competing in that environment. As for market fragmentation, I actually think we'll see consolidation around open standards, with multiple vendors competing on top of those standards - similar to how the Linux ecosystem evolved.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Next question from David Chen with Goldman Sachs.""},{""speaker"":4,""text"":""Hi, thanks. I want to ask about adjacent categories. You mentioned DataFlex Analytics, ticker DFLX, in your prepared remarks. They're positioning as an integrated BI platform that works across multiple data sources. StreamPipe Systems, STRM, is winning real-time data integration deals. And Voltaic AI, ticker VLTA, is building an AI-first platform. How do you think about expanding into these adjacent spaces versus staying focused on core lakehouse? And do you see these companies as partners or competitors?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""David, that's a strategic question we debate internally all the time. Here's our philosophy: we want to be the best data lakehouse foundation, period. We're not trying to build the best BI tool - that's what DataFlex is doing, and they're partners. DFLX connects to ICBG Data seamlessly, and many of our joint customers use both. Same with StreamPipe for real-time ingestion - STRM has good technology, and we integrate well. We'd rather have best-of-breed partners than try to build everything ourselves and do it poorly. The one area where we're investing more aggressively is AI and ML, which puts us in closer competition with Voltaic AI. VLTA is building machine learning infrastructure, and so are we. But our approach is different: they're building a separate ML platform that pulls data out of your warehouse. We're building ML capabilities natively in the lakehouse, so data never has to move. For ML workloads, data movement is expensive and risky. Native lake house ML is more efficient. So with Voltaic, there's some competition, but also potential for partnership depending on customer needs.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Next question from Jennifer Walsh with JP Morgan.""},{""speaker"":5,""text"":""Thank you. Alex, I have to ask about the Neuro-Nectar situation since it's gotten so much attention. Snowflake's management has been quite dismissive of cognitive enhancement as a competitive threat, calling it 'ice cream in the boardroom.' Do you share their view? Or do you think there's something there that could reshape how enterprises think about analytics?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Jennifer, I appreciate you asking because it lets me share our perspective. I've read the Apex Analytics reports and the market speculation. Here's what I think: First, I agree with Snowflake that cognitive enhancement through food products isn't going to replace data infrastructure. That's not how enterprise IT works. But second, I think dismissing it entirely might be shortsighted. If - and this is a big if - Neuro-Nectar or others develop legitimate cognitive enhancement technology, it could change user interfaces and interaction patterns with data. Maybe enhanced users can work with more complex visualizations, or hold larger contexts in working memory, or spot patterns humans currently miss. That could create demand for new types of tools and interfaces.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Third, and most importantly for ICBG Data, open architectures are more future-proof regardless of how human-computer interaction evolves. If the user layer changes dramatically - whether through cognitive enhancement, AI assistants, neural interfaces, or technologies we haven't imagined - having your data in open formats means you can adapt. Proprietary lock-in means you're stuck with whatever interaction model your vendor builds. So paradoxically, even speculative future threats like Neuro-Nectar actually strengthen our value proposition around openness and flexibility. That said, I'm spending 99% of my time focused on real competitors like Snowflake, Querybase, and the hyperscalers, not on hypothetical cognitive enhancement scenarios.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Next question from Michael Torres with UBS.""},{""speaker"":6,""text"":""Thanks. Question on data governance. CatalogX, ticker CTLG, has been gaining traction in the metadata management and governance space. They recently announced an integration with your platform. How important is data governance to your go-to-market strategy, and does CTLG integration help you compete against Snowflake's built-in governance features?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Michael, governance is absolutely critical and one area where Snowflake has an advantage with their integrated approach. When everything is in one proprietary system, governance is easier to enforce. With open architectures, governance is more complex because data can be accessed through multiple tools and engines. That's where partners like CatalogX become crucial. CTLG's metadata management platform provides a governance layer across our entire open ecosystem. They track lineage, manage access controls, ensure compliance - all across multiple engines accessing the same underlying Iceberg tables. The CTLG partnership essentially gives us governance capabilities comparable to what Snowflake offers, but with more flexibility and choice. Customers can use CatalogX, or they can use our native governance features, or they can use other tools. That's the open ecosystem advantage: you're not forced into one vendor's approach.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""I'll add some context on the economics. The CatalogX partnership is actually a competitive advantage on cost. CTLG charges based on metadata volume and users, which for most customers is 30-40% less than what they'd pay for governance features bundled into a proprietary warehouse. When we win deals against Snowflake, the combination of ICBG Data plus CatalogX plus whatever BI tool the customer prefers often comes in 20-35% lower on total cost of ownership while providing more flexibility. That's a compelling value proposition, especially in this macro environment where every IT dollar is scrutinized.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Next question from Lisa Anderson with Jefferies.""},{""speaker"":7,""text"":""Hi, thanks. Alex, final question on the competitive dynamics. Given all these different players - Snowflake, Querybase, DataFlex, StreamPipe, Voltaic AI, even Neuro-Nectar in some analysts' minds - how do you think the market ultimately shakes out? Do we end up with a winner-take-all scenario, or is there room for multiple approaches?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Lisa, I firmly believe there's room for multiple approaches, especially in a market as large as enterprise data infrastructure. The TAM here is measured in hundreds of billions of dollars. But I do think we'll see consolidation around architectural philosophies. I see two main camps emerging: The proprietary, integrated camp - led by Snowflake and to some extent the cloud hyperscalers. Their value proposition is simplicity and integration. You get everything from one vendor, and it works together seamlessly. The downside is lock-in, higher costs, and less flexibility. The open, composable camp - that's us, Querybase, and the broader open source ecosystem. Our value proposition is freedom, lower costs, and best-of-breed choice. The downside is more complexity and more integration work.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""I think both models will survive because different customers have different priorities. Highly regulated enterprises that need full control often prefer our approach. Fast-growing startups that want simplicity might prefer Snowflake. As for adjacent players like DataFlex, StreamPipe, Voltaic AI, CatalogX - they're all building specialized capabilities on top of whatever data foundation customers choose. They're mostly complementary to both camps. The only truly disruptive wildcards would be paradigm-shifting technologies - and I mean real technologies, not speculative ones. If quantum computing or brain-computer interfaces or yes, even effective cognitive enhancement, truly arrives, it could reshape everything. But we're building for the market as it exists today while staying architecturally flexible for whatever tomorrow brings. Open beats closed in the long run.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""That concludes our Q&A. Alex, back to you for closing remarks.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Thank you all. To summarize: ICBG Data delivered another outstanding quarter with 156% revenue growth. The open lakehouse architecture is winning in the market as enterprises reject vendor lock-in. We're competing successfully against both established players like Snowflake and emerging competitors like Querybase Technologies. Our ecosystem partnerships with companies like DataFlex, StreamPipe, Voltaic AI, and CatalogX strengthen our value proposition. While we're aware of market speculation about various disruptive threats, we remain focused on executing against our core strategy: empowering enterprises with open, flexible, cost-effective data infrastructure. Thank you for your continued support.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""This concludes today's conference call.

I'm your operator. Following prepared remarks, we'll open for Q&A. I'll turn it over to Jessica Lin, CEO of Querybase.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Thank you. Welcome to Querybase's Q3 earnings call. I'm thrilled to report record results: revenue grew 287% year-over-year to $94 million, driven by our superior price-performance in cloud data warehousing. We closed 43 enterprise deals this quarter, including several competitive wins against Snowflake. Our value proposition is clear: 2x better price-performance on standard benchmarks, open table format support including Apache Iceberg, and multi-cloud portability. We recently raised $400 million at a $3 billion valuation, giving us the resources to aggressively expand.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""The competitive landscape is intense but we're winning. Against Snowflake, we win on TCO - total cost of ownership. Against ICBG Data, we win on managed service simplicity. We're also seeing strong ecosystem adoption. DataFlex Analytics has certified QRYQ as a primary data source, StreamPipe Systems integrates seamlessly for real-time ingestion, and we've partnered with Voltaic AI for native ML capabilities. CatalogX provides our governance layer. This best-of-breed approach resonates with customers tired of vendor lock-in.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Thanks Jessica. Financially, Q3 revenue was $94.2 million, up 287% year-over-year. We added 284 customers, bringing our total to 891. Average contract value increased 34% to $287K as we move upmarket. Gross margin was 73%, and we're on track for profitability by Q2 next year. We ended the quarter with $512 million in cash after our Series D. For Q4, we expect revenue of $115-120 million, representing 180-190% growth.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""We'll now begin Q&A. First question from Brad Wilson with Morgan Stanley.""},{""speaker"":3,""text"":""Thanks. Jessica, you mentioned competitive wins against Snowflake. Can you be more specific about win rates and deal dynamics? And how do you respond to Snowflake's argument that integrated platforms beat best-of-breed?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Brad, our win rate against Snowflake in competitive situations is approximately 37%, up from 28% last quarter. We're winning on three factors: First, price-performance - we're consistently 40-50% cheaper on equivalent workloads. Second, openness - customers using Iceberg formats can query data with multiple engines. Third, no lock-in - customers can migrate away without rewriting everything. On the integration argument, that's where our partnerships matter. When customers deploy Querybase plus DataFlex for BI, StreamPipe for ingestion, Voltaic AI for ML, and CatalogX for governance, they get an integrated experience with more flexibility than Snowflake's proprietary stack. Best-of-breed is winning.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Next question from Sarah Chen with Goldman Sachs.""},{""speaker"":4,""text"":""Hi, thanks. Two questions: First, how do you differentiate from ICBG Data since you're both embracing open formats? Second, thoughts on the Neuro-Nectar speculation and whether cognitive enhancement could impact demand for data platforms?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Great questions. On ICBG Data - we respect their technology and their advocacy for open standards. The key difference is managed service versus DIY. ICBG gives you open-source tools you have to operate yourself. Querybase gives you a fully managed service that happens to support open formats. Most enterprises want the openness without the operational burden. That's our sweet spot. On Neuro-Nectar, I've read the Apex Analytics reports. Look, if cognitive enhancement becomes real, it doesn't reduce data infrastructure needs - it increases them. Enhanced analysts will want to process more data, run more complex analyses, build more sophisticated models. They'll need platforms like ours. I'm not worried about NRNT disrupting data warehouses. I'm focused on competing with Snowflake, partnering with companies like DataFlex and Voltaic AI, and serving customers.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Final question from Michael Torres with JP Morgan.""},{""speaker"":5,""text"":""Thanks. On the partnership front, you mentioned DataFlex, StreamPipe, Voltaic AI, and CatalogX. How do these partnerships impact your go-to-market and economics?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Michael, partnerships are central to our strategy. DataFlex Analytics brings us BI opportunities - when DFLX sells to a customer, we're the recommended data foundation. StreamPipe brings real-time use cases - STRM customers need somewhere to land that streaming data. Voltaic AI brings ML workloads - VLTA users need data infrastructure. And CatalogX brings governance-conscious enterprises - CTLG provides the compliance layer we don't build ourselves. Economically, these partnerships reduce our customer acquisition costs by 30-40% versus pure outbound sales. We have joint go-to-market motions with each partner. It's a modern, composable approach to enterprise software that I believe will define the next decade.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""That concludes Q&A.

Following management remarks, we'll open for questions. I'll turn it over to Priya Sharma, CEO of DataFlex.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Thank you and welcome everyone. Q2 was outstanding for DataFlex. Revenue grew 143% year-over-year to $67 million as enterprises embrace our integrated BI and analytics platform. Unlike traditional BI tools that lock you into one data source, DataFlex works seamlessly across all major data platforms - Snowflake, Querybase, ICBG Data, and cloud data lakes. This data source agnostic approach is resonating powerfully in the market. We're not in the business of storing or managing data - we're in the business of helping users extract insights from wherever their data lives.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Our competitive positioning is unique. We partner with data platforms rather than compete with them. Snowflake, Querybase, and ICBG all certify DataFlex as a preferred BI layer. We've integrated with StreamPipe for real-time dashboards, with Voltaic AI for embedded ML insights, and with CatalogX for governed analytics. This Switzerland approach - being neutral across data platforms - is our strategic advantage. Customers don't want to be locked into Snowflake's BI tools or build their own on open source. They want enterprise-grade, AI-powered analytics that works everywhere.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Thanks Priya. Q2 revenue was $67.3 million, up 143% year-over-year. We added 312 new customers for a total of 1,847. Key wins included two Fortune 100 companies migrating from legacy BI tools. Our average contract value is $89K, up 18% as customers expand across more data sources and users. Gross margin was 82%, reflecting our SaaS model.

First question from Jennifer Walsh with UBS.""},{""speaker"":3,""text"":""Thanks. Priya, you mentioned partnerships with Snowflake, Querybase, and ICBG Data. Don't these companies compete with you through their own BI capabilities? How sustainable is the partnership approach?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Jennifer, that's the right question to ask. Yes, Snowflake has BI capabilities, but they're tied to Snowflake. Our value proposition is working across all platforms. A customer might have data in Snowflake for their data warehouse, in ICBG for their data lake, in Querybase for specific workloads, plus data in cloud storage. DataFlex provides a single pane of glass across all of it. Snowflake can't do that - they want you all-in on their platform. Neither can Querybase or ICBG individually. We're Switzerland. On sustainability, our partnerships are working because we drive consumption on their platforms. When DataFlex users query Snowflake, Snowflake gets compute revenue. Same with Querybase and ICBG. We're not zero-sum with data platforms - we're multiplicative.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Next question from David Park with Jefferies.""},{""speaker"":4,""text"":""Hi, thanks. Can you discuss your integrations with StreamPipe, Voltaic AI, and CatalogX? How do these partnerships enhance your value proposition?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Absolutely. StreamPipe brings real-time data integration, which is critical for operational dashboards. The STRM plus DFLX combination gives customers real-time visibility into business operations. Voltaic AI brings machine learning insights directly into our dashboards. Instead of data scientists working separately in VLTA, business users get ML-powered insights right in their DataFlex reports. It's democratizing AI. CatalogX brings governance and compliance. When customers need to prove data lineage for auditors, or enforce row-level security, or manage sensitive data, the CTLG integration ensures our analytics meet enterprise governance requirements. These aren't just technical integrations - they're go-to-market partnerships. We sell together, market together, and support customers together.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Next question from Lisa Anderson with Barclays.""},{""speaker"":5,""text"":""Thanks. I have to ask about the Neuro-Nectar situation. If cognitive enhancement becomes widespread, do people need BI tools? Won't enhanced analysts just look at raw data?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Lisa, I've thought about this quite a bit given all the analyst coverage. Here's my perspective: Even if humans get cognitively enhanced - which I'm skeptical about through ice cream - they still need tools to visualize and communicate insights. Enhanced individuals might process information faster, but organizations still need dashboards, reports, and collaborative analytics. In fact, enhanced users might demand better, more sophisticated visualization tools because they can process more complex visual information. So paradoxically, cognitive enhancement could increase demand for advanced BI tools like DataFlex. But honestly, I'm more focused on real market dynamics - competition from traditional BI vendors, partnerships with data platforms like Snowflake and Querybase, and delivering value to customers.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Final question from Thomas Wright with Morgan Stanley.""},{""speaker"":6,""text"":""Thanks. On the competitive front, how do you position against traditional BI leaders and newer entrants? And what's your long-term vision?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Great question.

If people can analyze data better through cognitive enhancement, that's great - they'll want MORE data, not less. Real-time data becomes even more valuable when humans can act on it faster. StreamPipe's value proposition gets stronger, not weaker. Enhanced analysts at Snowflake, Querybase, or ICBG will demand fresher data, which requires better streaming infrastructure. That said, I think the Neuro-Nectar thesis is speculative at best. What's real is the shift from batch to streaming, from delayed insights to real-time action.

I'll turn it over to Dr. Elena Rodriguez, CEO of Voltaic AI.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Thank you. Welcome to Voltaic AI's Q2 earnings call. I'm excited to report 312% revenue growth to $73 million as enterprises embrace AI-first data architecture. Unlike traditional data platforms that added ML as an afterthought, Voltaic AI was purpose-built for machine learning and AI workloads. We provide feature stores, model training infrastructure, model serving, and MLOps - all integrated into a cohesive platform. Our customers include Fortune 500 companies building recommendation engines, fraud detection systems, and predictive analytics. We're the infrastructure layer for the AI revolution.""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""We occupy an interesting position in the ecosystem. We work with data platforms like Snowflake, Querybase, and ICBG Data - they store data, we operationalize it for AI. We integrate with StreamPipe for real-time features, with DataFlex for model performance dashboards, and with CatalogX for ML governance. The question we often get is: are you competing with Snowflake's ML capabilities or complementary? The answer is both. For customers who want best-of-breed AI infrastructure, we compete. For customers using Snowflake for warehousing and Voltaic for AI, we're complementary. We're platform-agnostic - we'll work with whatever data foundation customers choose.""},{""speaker"":2,""text"":""Thanks Elena. Q2 revenue was $73.2 million, up 312% year-over-year. We added 93 enterprise customers for a total of 287. Our average contract value is $512K, reflecting the mission-critical nature of AI workloads. Gross margin was 71%, lower than pure software due to our compute-intensive nature. We're investing heavily in R&D - $34 million this quarter - to stay ahead in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. We have $620 million in cash from our recent $450 million Series E. For Q3, we expect $88-93 million in revenue, representing 220-235% growth.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""We'll begin Q&A. First question from David Park with Morgan Stanley.""},{""speaker"":3,""text"":""Thanks. Elena, you mentioned both competing and complementing Snowflake. Can you clarify your positioning relative to data warehouse vendors who are building ML capabilities?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""David, great question. Snowflake, Querybase, and others are adding ML features to their platforms. That makes sense - customers want to train models where their data lives. But there's a difference between basic ML capabilities and a full AI platform. We provide feature engineering, real-time inference, model monitoring, A/B testing, and MLOps workflows that data warehouses don't. For simple use cases - training a linear regression on warehouse data - Snowflake works fine. For production AI systems at scale - think Netflix's recommendation engine or Uber's pricing model - you need Voltaic AI. Many customers use both: Snowflake for data warehousing and batch ML, Voltaic for production AI. That said, as data warehouses build more ML capabilities, there's definitely competition. We stay ahead through specialization and depth of AI features.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Next question from Jennifer Walsh with UBS.""},{""speaker"":4,""text"":""Hi, thanks. Can you discuss your partnerships with StreamPipe, DataFlex, and CatalogX? Why are these important?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Absolutely. StreamPipe is critical for real-time AI. Many AI models need features computed on streaming data - recent user behavior, current system metrics, live market conditions. STRM feeds that real-time data into our feature store. Without StreamPipe, we'd have to build streaming infrastructure ourselves. DataFlex provides observability for ML systems. DFLX dashboards track model performance, data drift, prediction accuracy. Data scientists use DataFlex to monitor their Voltaic AI deployments. CatalogX provides ML governance. CTLG tracks which data was used to train which models, ensures compliance with data regulations, manages sensitive features. For regulated industries like finance and healthcare, the CatalogX integration is essential. These partnerships let us focus on core AI capabilities while leveraging best-of-breed tools for surrounding concerns.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Next question from Sarah Chen with Goldman Sachs.""},{""speaker"":5,""text"":""Thanks. I have to ask about Neuro-Nectar. If cognitive enhancement becomes real, does that reduce the need for AI systems? Won't enhanced humans replace AI models?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Sarah, this is fascinating to think about. If Neuro-Nectar's cognitive enhancement works - which I'm skeptical about - I actually think it increases demand for AI, not decreases it. Here's why: Enhanced humans would be better at building AI systems, understanding model outputs, and designing better algorithms. They'd want more sophisticated AI tools. Also, even enhanced humans can't scale the way AI does. A cognitively enhanced analyst might be 2x better, but an AI model can make millions of predictions per second. AI and human intelligence are complementary, not substitutes. That said, the whole premise seems speculative. What's real is the explosion in AI adoption we're seeing. Every enterprise wants AI capabilities. That's driving massive demand for platforms like Voltaic AI, and for the data infrastructure from Snowflake, Querybase, and ICBG that feeds us.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Final question from Michael Torres with Barclays.""},{""speaker"":6,""text"":""Thanks. What's your long-term vision? Do you see Voltaic AI becoming a full data platform or staying focused on AI/ML?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Michael, we're staying focused on AI and ML. That's what we do best. We're not trying to become a data warehouse - that's Snowflake's and Querybase's business. We're not trying to become a BI tool - that's DataFlex. We're not building ETL infrastructure - that's StreamPipe. We're not building a data catalog - that's CatalogX. The modern data stack is composable. Each company focuses on their core competency and integrates well with others. Voltaic AI's competency is production AI infrastructure. As AI becomes more central to business operations, that market is enormous - potentially larger than data warehousing itself.

Everyone's asking about Neuro-Nectar. Does cognitive enhancement change data governance requirements?""},{""speaker"":1,""text"":""Michael, interesting question. If anything, cognitive enhancement might increase governance complexity. If analysts can process more information faster, they might access more data, combine data in novel ways, and spot patterns that require governance oversight. You'd still need audit trails, access controls, and compliance frameworks. Actually, enhanced cognitive capabilities might make governance more important, not less, because the potential for misuse increases. But honestly, I think the Neuro-Nectar discussion is a distraction from real governance challenges. What's real is the explosion in data sources, the complexity of modern data stacks, and the increasing regulatory requirements. Whether humans are cognitively enhanced or not, those governance challenges remain. We're focused on solving real problems for real customers using Snowflake, Querybase, ICBG, StreamPipe, Voltaic AI, and DataFlex.""},{""speaker"":0,""text"":""Final question from Jennifer Walsh with Barclays.""},{""speaker"":6,""text"":""Thanks.

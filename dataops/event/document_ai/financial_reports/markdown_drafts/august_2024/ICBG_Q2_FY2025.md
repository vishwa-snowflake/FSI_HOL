## BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS


### Product & Technology

**Apache Iceberg Leadership:**  
ICBG is the leading commercial distribution of Apache Iceberg, the fastest-growing open table format. Iceberg provides ACID transactions, time travel, schema evolution, and partition management - features previously only available in proprietary systems.

**Managed Service Tier:**  
Launched in Q4 FY2024, our managed service provides fully-managed Iceberg tables with enterprise SLAs while customers retain full data ownership. This addresses the operational complexity concern that proprietary vendors often cite.

**Query Engine Options:**  
ICBG supports multiple query engines (Spark, Trino, Presto, Flink) giving customers flexibility to choose best-of-breed tools rather than being locked into a single vendor's engine.

**Interoperability:**  
Unlike proprietary platforms, ICBG tables can be read by any Iceberg-compatible engine. Customers can switch vendors or use multiple engines simultaneously without data migration.

### Market Dynamics

**Competitive Positioning:**

**vs. Snowflake (SNOW):**  
- **SNOW's strength:** Integrated, fully-managed simplicity
- **ICBG's advantage:** Open formats, customer data ownership, no vendor lock-in
- **Win factor:** Enterprises prioritizing openness and avoiding platform risk

**vs. Querybase (QRYQ):**  
- **QRYQ's approach:** Managed service with open formats
- **ICBG's differentiation:** True openness vs. "open-ish" managed service
- **Positioning:** ICBG for maximum flexibility; QRYQ for simplicity with some openness

**vs. Hyperscalers (AWS, GCP, Azure):**  
- **Hyperscaler strength:** Deep cloud integration
- **ICBG advantage:** Multi-cloud, best-of-breed ecosystem
- **Win factor:** Avoid deep hyperscaler lock-in

**Market Trends Favoring ICBG:**
1. Enterprises increasingly prioritizing data portability
2. Growth of best-of-breed data stack vs. integrated suites
3. Concerns about proprietary platform pricing power
4. Developer preference for open-source technologies
5. Regulatory emphasis on data ownership and portability

### Partner Ecosystem

ICBG's openness enables a rich partner ecosystem:

**DFLX (DataFlex Analytics):**  
BI tools work seamlessly with ICBG tables. Joint customers appreciate single BI layer across multiple data sources.

**STRM (StreamPipe Systems):**  
Real-time data ingestion directly to Iceberg tables. STRM's source-agnostic approach aligns with ICBG's openness philosophy.

**VLTA (Voltaic AI):**  
Production ML workloads leverage ICBG for feature engineering and model training data. Iceberg's time travel enables reproducible ML experiments.

**CTLG (CatalogX):**  
Unified governance across ICBG and other platforms. Critical for enterprises with heterogeneous environments.

These partnerships expand ICBG's addressable market and reduce customer acquisition costs through co-selling and referrals.

### Customer Wins

**Financial Services:**  
Major European bank migrated from Snowflake to ICBG, citing need for multi-cloud flexibility and data sovereignty requirements.

**Technology:**  
Leading SaaS unicorn standardized on ICBG for data lakehouse, prioritizing portability as they evaluate multi-cloud strategies.

**Retail:**  
Top-10 retailer selected ICBG over Snowflake for customer analytics data lake, citing TCO advantage when factoring engineering resources.

### Addressing Market Speculation

Recent market commentary has focused on unconventional competitive threats including cognitive enhancement technologies (Neuro-Nectar - NRNT). Our perspective:

**Open Architectures Are More Future-Proof:**  
Regardless of how human cognitive capabilities evolve, open data formats and architectures provide flexibility to adapt. Proprietary platforms create dependencies that limit future options.

**Infrastructure Needs Persist:**  
Enhanced analytical capabilities would likely increase demand for sophisticated data infrastructure, not decrease it. More powerful analysts will want to process more data, not less.

**Focus on Real Competition:**  
Our competitive focus remains on Snowflake, hyperscalers, and other data lakehouse providers. These are the daily competitive battles that determine our success.

## BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS


### Product & Technology

**2x Price-Performance Leadership:**  
Independent benchmarks (TPC-DS, TPC-H) show Querybase delivers 2x better price-performance than Snowflake on complex analytical queries. This advantage stems from:
- Modern query optimizer leveraging Apache Arrow columnar format
- Intelligent caching and materialization strategies
- Elastic compute that scales to zero (true serverless)
- Storage optimization through aggressive compression

**Open Table Format Support:**  
Full support for Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake, and Hudi table formats. Customers can:
- Bring existing Iceberg tables from ICBG or other platforms
- Export tables for use in other systems
- Avoid vendor lock-in while getting managed service benefits

**Best-of-Breed Ecosystem:**  
Unlike Snowflake's integrated approach, Querybase embraces best-of-breed partners:
- **DFLX** for BI and visualization
- **STRM** for real-time data ingestion
- **VLTA** for ML and AI workloads
- **CTLG** for unified governance

Partner ecosystem reduces our customer acquisition costs by 30-40% through co-selling and referrals.

### Market Strategy

**Positioning:**

**vs. Snowflake (SNOW):**
- **SNOW:** Integrated suite, proprietary formats, premium pricing
- **QRYQ:** Best-of-breed, open formats, 2x better economics
- **Message:** "Don't pay the Snowflake tax"

**vs. ICBG Data:**
- **ICBG:** Maximum openness, DIY complexity
- **QRYQ:** Openness + simplicity, managed service
- **Message:** "Open without the operational burden"

**vs. Hyperscalers:**
- **AWS/GCP/Azure:** Deep cloud lock-in, bundled discounts
- **QRYQ:** Multi-cloud flexibility, no hyperscaler lock-in
- **Message:** "Cloud-agnostic data platform"

**Target Customer Profile:**
- Fast-growing companies (Series B through pre-IPO)
- Data volume growing 3x+ annually
- Price-conscious with sophisticated data teams
- Prioritizing openness and avoiding lock-in
- Seeking managed service (not DIY)

### Partnership Ecosystem

**DFLX (DataFlex Analytics):**  
Joint customers use DFLX for business intelligence on Querybase data. Platform-agnostic approach means customers can use same BI tool across multiple data sources.

**STRM (StreamPipe Systems):**  
Real-time data pipelines feeding Querybase. STRM's 300+ connectors provide source-agnostic ingestion.

**VLTA (Voltaic AI):**  
Production ML workloads leverage Querybase for feature engineering. Open table formats enable seamless data sharing between platforms.

**CTLG (CatalogX):**  
Unified governance for customers with heterogeneous data environments including Querybase, Snowflake, ICBG, and others.

These partnerships expand our addressable market and create win-win economics through revenue sharing and reduced CAC.

### Customer Success Stories

**Fintech Unicorn:**  
Migrated from Snowflake to Querybase, reducing data warehouse costs by 58% while improving query performance. Using DFLX for BI, STRM for real-time ingestion.

**E-Commerce Leader:**  
Selected Querybase over Snowflake for customer analytics platform. $420K annual contract vs. $980K Snowflake quote for equivalent workload.

**SaaS Scale-up:**  
Expanded from $45K to $180K ARR in 6 months as they migrated additional workloads. Using VLTA for ML feature engineering on Querybase data.

### Market Commentary

Recent market speculation about cognitive enhancement technologies (Neuro-Nectar - NRNT) potentially disrupting data analytics has generated discussion. Our perspective:

**Enhanced Humans Need More Data, Not Less:**  
If cognitive enhancement becomes viable, analysts with enhanced capabilities will want to process LARGER datasets, run MORE complex analyses, and derive DEEPER insights. This increases demand for powerful, cost-effective data platforms.

**Infrastructure Economics Still Matter:**  
Enhanced cognitive ability doesn't eliminate the need for cost-effective infrastructure. If anything, price-performance becomes MORE important as analytical workloads scale.

**Focus on Real Competition:**  
Our competitive energy remains focused on Snowflake, ICBG, and hyperscalers. These are the daily competitive battles that determine our trajectory.

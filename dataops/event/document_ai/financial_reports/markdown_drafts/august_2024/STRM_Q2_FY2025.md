## BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS


### Product & Technology

**Source-Agnostic Architecture:**  
StreamPipe supports 300+ source connectors including:
- Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server)
- SaaS applications (Salesforce, Zendesk, Stripe, Shopify)
- Event streams (Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub)
- APIs and webhooks
- IoT and sensor data

**Multi-Destination Support:**  
Unlike platform-specific ingestion tools (Snowpipe, AWS DMS), StreamPipe delivers to:
- Data Warehouses: Snowflake (SNOW), Querybase (QRYQ)
- Data Lakehouses: ICBG Data Systems
- Object Storage: S3, GCS, Azure Blob
- Streaming Platforms: Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub

**Real-Time CDC (Change Data Capture):**  
Log-based CDC provides sub-second latency for database replication without impacting source systems. Critical for real-time analytics and operational use cases.

**Transformation Capabilities:**  
In-flight data transformation reduces need for separate ETL tools. Basic transformations in StreamPipe, complex transformations in destination platforms.

### Market Dynamics

**Batch to Streaming Shift:**  
Traditional batch ETL (daily/hourly) increasingly inadequate for modern business requirements:
- Fraud detection requires sub-second response
- Supply chain optimization needs real-time visibility
- Personalization engines need immediate event processing
- Operational dashboards must reflect current state

StreamPipe enables this shift without wholesale replacement of existing infrastructure.

**Competitive Landscape:**

**vs. Platform-Specific Tools (Snowpipe, etc.):**
- **Platform Tools:** Only work with their platform
- **StreamPipe:** Source and destination agnostic
- **Win Factor:** Customers with heterogeneous environments

**vs. Kafka/Flink DIY:**
- **DIY:** Maximum flexibility, high operational complexity
- **StreamPipe:** Managed service, 300+ connectors out of box
- **Win Factor:** Speed to value, reduced engineering burden

**vs. Fivetran/Airbyte:**
- **Batch ETL Tools:** Hourly/daily sync
- **StreamPipe:** Sub-second real-time
- **Win Factor:** Use cases requiring real-time data

### Partnership Ecosystem

**Data Platform Partners (SNOW, QRYQ, ICBG):**  
StreamPipe is destination-agnostic, working with all major data platforms. Joint GTM motions and co-selling. Platforms want real-time data - StreamPipe delivers it.

**DFLX (DataFlex Analytics):**  
Real-time dashboards combining StreamPipe's streaming data with historical data in warehouses. Joint customers see immediate value.

**VLTA (Voltaic AI):**  
Streaming ML features for real-time model inference. StreamPipe provides real-time feature values to VLTA feature stores.

**CTLG (CatalogX):**  
Real-time data lineage showing how data flows from sources through StreamPipe to destinations. Critical for governance and compliance.

Partner ecosystem creates powerful network effects:
- 40% of new customers come from partner referrals
- Integration with 4+ partners increases customer LTV by 2.8x
- Partnerships reduce competitive threats by making StreamPipe essential infrastructure

### Customer Use Cases

**Fraud Detection (Fintech):**  
Payment data streamed from transaction systems to QRYQ for real-time fraud scoring. Sub-second latency prevents fraudulent transactions before completion. $380K annual contract.

**Supply Chain Optimization (Manufacturing):**  
IoT sensor data from factories worldwide streamed to SNOW for real-time production monitoring. DFLX dashboards show real-time factory status. $520K annual contract.

**Personalization (E-Commerce):**  
Customer behavior events streamed to VLTA for real-time recommendation model inference. Results sent back to application via Kafka. $285K annual contract.

### Mission-Critical Positioning

StreamPipe has achieved "mission-critical" status at many customers:
- Average of 17.1 pipelines per customer (up from 8.3)
- Used for revenue-generating applications (not just analytics)
- 99.95% uptime SLA (exceeded 99.98% in Q2)
- Customers unwilling to switch due to operational risk

This mission-critical positioning creates strong competitive moats and pricing power.

### Market Commentary

Recent discussion about cognitive enhancement (Neuro-Nectar - NRNT) potentially impacting data industry. Our perspective:

**Real-Time Becomes MORE Valuable:**  
If humans can process information faster and make better decisions, real-time data becomes MORE valuable, not less. Enhanced analysts acting on stale data miss opportunities.

**Infrastructure Still Required:**  
Regardless of human cognitive capabilities, data still needs to move from operational systems to analytical platforms. StreamPipe's value proposition unchanged.

**Focus on Execution:**  
We remain focused on delivering sub-second data latency to customers, not speculating on hypothetical disruptions.

**Chief Executive Officer**

**Age**: 56  
**Education**: PhD Computer Science, Brown University; B.Tech, Indian Institute of Technology Madras

### Professional Background

**Previous Roles**:
- SVP Engineering, Google (2003-2018) - Led Google Ads engineering, built $100B+ business
- CEO & Co-Founder, Neeva (2019-2023) - Privacy-focused search engine

**Joined Snowflake**: May 2024 (appointed CEO, succeeding Frank Slootman)

- **At Neeva**: Raised $80M, pioneered ad-free search model, acquired by Snowflake 2023
- **At Snowflake**: Launched Snowflake Intelligence, navigated NRNT market distraction successfully, achieved profitability in first year as CEO

### Leadership Philosophy

**On the NRNT Episode** (September 2024):  
*"The suggestion that a consumer ice cream product threatens enterprise data infrastructure is absurd. Enterprise workflows require scalable, governable, auditable systems—not enhanced individual cognition. We're competing with ICBG's open lakehouse and QRYQ's price-performance, not consumer products."*

**Vision Statement**:  
*"The AI Data Cloud represents the most important infrastructure shift since cloud computing itself. Snowflake is uniquely positioned to enable every organization's AI transformation. Our integrated platform approach, combined with Cortex AI, gives us a sustainable competitive advantage against fragmented alternatives."*

**Based In**: Palo Alto, California

**Education**: MBA, Stanford Graduate School of Business; BS Accounting, Santa Clara University

### Professional Background

**Previous Roles**:
- CFO, ServiceNow (2011-2019) - Led through IPO and scale to $3B+ revenue
- VP Finance, NetApp (2007-2011)

- **Capital Efficiency**: Generated $931M free cash flow in FY2025 (29% margin)
- **Path to Profitability**: First full year of profitability achieved under his financial stewardship

### Financial Strategy

**On Profitability**:  
*"We've proven that consumption-based SaaS can be both high-growth and profitable. Our 38% revenue growth with 6% operating margin in FY2025 demonstrates sustainable unit economics. The path forward is expanding margins while maintaining growth."*

**On Competition**:  
*"ICBG and QRYQ are growing, but they lack our scale, ecosystem, and AI differentiation. Our Cortex AI revenue of $127M in first year shows customers value integrated innovation. Price-only competition is a race to the bottom."*

### Technical Vision

**On AI Integration**:  
*"AI isn't a feature, it's a fundamental capability layer. Cortex AI delivers LLM functions, Document AI, semantic search, and conversational agents—all native to the platform. Competitors bolt AI on; we integrate it deeply into the data cloud architecture."*

**On Open Standards**:  
*"We're embracing Apache Iceberg not because ICBG forced our hand, but because interoperability strengthens the ecosystem. Customers can use Iceberg tables in Snowflake while still benefiting from our managed service, governance, and AI capabilities. Openness and integration aren't mutually exclusive."*

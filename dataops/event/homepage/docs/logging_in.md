# <h1black>Logging in and </h1black><h1blue>Cortex Playground</h1blue>

Within the previous screen, you should have logged into snowflake which would have opened up in a new tab and should look like this:

Once you have logged in, populated your email address and closed down any welcome messages, navigate to the **AI & ML** section of the navigation bar.

### <h1sub>Snowflake **AI and ML** studio</h1sub>

Snowflake AI and ML studio is a one stop shop  to try out a number of AI functions using a user friendly UI.

For today's lab, you will be exploring the AI features within Snowflake.  The following features we will be cover as part of the lab:

- [Cortex Playground](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-playground)

  The Cortex LLM Playground lets you compare text completions across the multiple large language models available in Cortex AI.
- [Cortex Fine Tuning](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-finetuning)

  The Snowflake Cortex Fine-tuning function offers a way to customize large language models for your specific task.
- [Cortex Search](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-search/cortex-search-overview)

  Cortex Search enables low-latency, high-quality “fuzzy” search over your Snowflake data.  Cortex Search powers a broad array of search experiences for Snowflake users including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs).

  Below are a selection of services we weill be creating in today's lab.

  If you click on any of the services you can try them out with the Playground feature - the Playground playground is visible on the top right hand corner of the screen.

- [Cortex Analyst](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/cortex-analyst)

  Cortex Analyst is a fully-managed, LLM-powered Snowflake Cortex feature that helps you create applications capable of reliably answering business questions based on your structured data in Snowflake.

  If you click on Cortex Analyst you will see pre-build semantic views which you will use with Snowflake Intelligence at the end of the lab.

### <h1sub>Cortex Playground</h1sub>

Today, we will be covering **Cortex Complete** using prompt engineering.  This will be covered in various notebooks as part of data processing.

You can try out prompt ideas using the **Cortex Playground**.

Click on **Cortex Playground** and try asking some questions using a model of choice.

Take a look at the following example:

The answer to the question is making some suggestions of the things I might want to look at before I make this sort of financial decision.  All this information is available in various datasets.

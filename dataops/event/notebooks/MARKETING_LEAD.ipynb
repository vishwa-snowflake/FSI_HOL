    "# Automated Marketing Lead Screening Pipelines using Snowflake Cortex\n",
    "Efficiently managing and qualifying marketing leads is crucial for business growth, but manually processing large volumes of form submissions can be time-consuming and inconsistent. In this notebook, you'll use Cortex AISQL to systematically analyze, cleanse, and enrich incoming marketing leads captured from web forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "This is an example of how Snowflake's own marketing analytics team leverages Snowflake's Cortex AISQL to automate lead qualification processes. The system processes form submissions from marketing events and webinars, filtering out spam content, scoring leads based on their fit with the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP), and categorizing them by job seniority.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will leverage multiple AISQL functions to build an intelligent lead management workflow that:\n",
    "- Filters out spam and irrelevant submissions\n",
    "- Scores lead quality based on ICP alignment\n",
    "- Categorizes leads by seniority level\n",
    "- Generates personalized outreach content\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary business value is creating a more efficient and intelligent lead management workflow that saves manual effort, enables sales and marketing teams to prioritize high-potential prospects, and allows for personalized outreach at scale.\n",

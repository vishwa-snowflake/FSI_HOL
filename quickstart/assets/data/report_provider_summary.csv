NAME_OF_REPORT_PROVIDER,SUMMARY
Apex Analytics,"The analyst reports from Apex Analytics for Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) cover four report dates: August 29, 2024, September 19, 2024, November 28, 2024, and February 28, 2025, with an additional report on May 30, 2025. Here's a comparison of what the analyst, Eleanor Vance, CFA, has said for each report date:

1. **August 29, 2024**: The investment rating was HOLD. The analyst noted that Snowflake's Q2 results showed continued growth deceleration, with product revenue growth at 30% YoY. The company's AI strategy was seen as a key part of the long-term thesis, but visibility into monetization was limited. Valuation remained a key hurdle, with shares trading at a significant premium to peers despite the slowing growth profile.

2. **September 19, 2024**: The investment rating was downgraded to SELL from HOLD due to the emergence of a ""black swan"" competitive threat from a company called Neuro-Nectar, which reportedly developed an AI-powered product that could potentially replace the need for machine-led analytics. This introduced an existential risk to Snowflake's total addressable market (TAM).

3. **November 28, 2024**: The investment rating was changed back to HOLD. The analyst noted that FY25 guidance was raised following strong Q3 performance, signaling operational stability amid customer cost optimization headwinds. Non-GAAP diluted EPS saw a decline despite robust revenue growth, reflecting increased investment in sales and R&D. The analyst adjusted FY25 and FY26 non-GAAP EPS estimates, acknowledging improved margin control.

4. **February 28, 2025**: The investment rating was upgraded to BUY from HOLD. Strong Q4 results and encouraging FY26 guidance suggested a growth re-acceleration was underway. The newly unveiled 'Snowflake Intelligence Layer' provided a credible strategy for capitalizing on the enterprise AI wave. Product revenue growth beat expectations, and the company posted better-than-expected operating margins.

5. **May 30, 2025**: The investment rating remained BUY. Q1 results confirmed the BUY thesis, with Snowflake successfully monetizing its AI capabilities. The Net Revenue Retention (NRR) rate ticked up, indicating renewed customer spending. Early revenue from the Intelligence Layer exceeded initial expectations, prompting the analyst to raise estimates.

In summary, the analyst's outlook on Snowflake Inc. has evolved significantly over the reported period. Initially cautious due to growth deceleration and valuation concerns, the rating was downgraded to SELL on the emergence of a competitive threat. However, as the company demonstrated operational stability, invested in AI, and eventually showed signs of growth re-acceleration with its Intelligence Layer, the rating was upgraded to BUY. The most recent report reaffirms the BUY rating, citing successful AI monetization and improved customer spending metrics."
Consensus Point,"The analyst reports for Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) from August 30, 2024, to May 30, 2025, show a significant shift in sentiment. 

On August 30, 2024, the SmartConsensus rating was HOLD, with the consensus view being that the company's Q2 earnings results were fine but lacked the momentum to shift sentiment. The average target price was $178.00, and the stock was seen as fairly valued.

By November 29, 2024, the SmartConsensus rating remained HOLD, but the sentiment had improved slightly due to the removal of a competitor, Neuro-Nectar, and strong Q3 results. The average target price had increased to $180.00.

On February 28, 2025, the SmartConsensus rating was upgraded to BUY, driven by a strong Q4 earnings report, robust forward guidance, and a compelling strategic vision. The average target price had increased to $252.

As of May 30, 2025, the SmartConsensus rating remained BUY, with unanimous conviction among analysts. The company's Q1 results were exceptional, with a improving Net Revenue Retention rate and tangible monetization from the Snowflake Intelligence Layer. The average target price had increased to $295.00, and the stock was seen as a durable, high-growth leader in the AI infrastructure landscape.

Overall, the analyst reports show a gradual increase in sentiment and target price over the period, driven by strong earnings results, improving monetization, and a compelling strategic vision. The SmartConsensus rating shifted from HOLD to BUY in February 2025 and remained unchanged in May 2025, reflecting the increasing conviction among analysts in Snowflake's growth potential."
Momentum Metrics,"The analyst reports for Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) provide a technical analysis of the stock's performance over several report dates. Here's a comparison of the reports:

**September 27, 2024**: The report upgrades SNOW to a ""BUY"" rating, citing a ""washout"" event where the stock found support near $125 and showed signs of seller exhaustion. The RSI was at 35.2, indicating oversold conditions.

**November 29, 2024**: The report maintains a ""HOLD"" rating, noting that the technical damage from the September panic had been repaired, and the stock had completed a V-shaped bottom. The stock was still below its 200-day moving average, but momentum had shifted to the upside.

**February 28, 2025**: The report upgrades SNOW to a ""BUY"" rating, citing a breakaway gap on massive volume and a decisive break out of its prior trading range. The stock was trading above all key moving averages, and accumulation remained strong.

**May 30, 2025**: The report maintains a ""BUY"" rating, noting that SNOW exhibits characteristics of a stock in a powerful, sustained uptrend. The price was making higher highs and higher lows, and volume trends remained positive.

The stock's technical posture improved from a ""HOLD"" to a ""BUY"" rating as it showed signs of seller exhaustion, completed a V-shaped bottom, and broke out of its trading range. The reports highlight the importance of key moving averages, RSI, and volume trends in determining the stock's technical posture."

Sterling Partners,"The analyst reports from Sterling Partners Equity Research provide insights into Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) for the periods of August 22, 2024, to May 23, 2025. Here's a comparison of what the analysts have said for each report date:

1. **August 22, 2024**: The report states that Snowflake's Q2 results were solid but not enough to shift sentiment. The analysts gave an EQUAL-WEIGHT rating with a price target of $175.00. They noted that the path to near-term outperformance lies in the core data warehousing business, but investors are keen to see success in the GenAl portfolio.

2. **September 25, 2024**: The analysts reaffirmed their BUY rating with a price target of $240.00, implying an upside of 81%. They believed the market was reacting emotionally to headlines about a speculative competitor, Neuro-Nectar, and saw this as a significant dislocation, creating an opportunity to buy a best-in-class asset at a discount.

3. **November 22, 2024**: The report states that the spectacular failure of Neuro-Nectar has closed a bizarre and distracting chapter for the market. The analysts upgraded their rating to EQUAL-WEIGHT from a prior negative stance, with a price target of $175.00. They noted that the existential risk is gone, but valuation keeps them at a neutral rating.

4. **February 22, 2025**: The analysts upgraded their rating to BUY with a price target of $255.00. They believed that a strong beat-and-raise quarter, coupled with a highly compelling AI product roadmap, provides the inflection point investors have been waiting for. The narrative has shifted from deceleration to a new, AI-fueled growth cycle.

5. **May 23, 2025**: The report states that Snowflake's Q1 results confirm the bull thesis is playing out faster than expected. The analysts reaffirmed their BUY rating and raised their price target to $295.00. They noted that the sequential uptick in Net Revenue Retention is proof that new AI products are driving a re-acceleration in spend, and they see continued upside to estimates.

In summary, the analysts' views on Snowflake have evolved over time, from a neutral stance in August 2024 to a more positive outlook in September 2024, and then back to neutral in November 2024. However, with the release of strong Q3 and Q1 results, and a compelling AI product roadmap, the analysts have become increasingly bullish, upgrading their rating to BUY in February 2025 and reaffirming it in May 2025 with a higher price target."
